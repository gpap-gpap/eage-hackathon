The dataset used for training the ANN consisted of various gasifier environments and petrographic and chemical properties of fifty-five feed coal samples. The results of the ANN showed an acceptable correlation and can be used to predict gasifier performance. Additionally, Correlation Fractal Dimension signatures were used to understand the Overlying Strata Dynamics in Longwall Coal Mines, and a novel process of coal gasification and coking to methanol production was examined.

The Multi-Layer Feed Forward Network (MLFN) was trained with fourteen samples of Indian and South African feed coal input parameters, including ash content, feed coal rate, particle size, and bed temperature. The results showed an acceptable correlation and can be used over a wide range of varieties for feed coal. The model was tested with low and high feed rates of coal from the Sohagpur coalfield, showing lower syn gas concentration and carbon conversion at the higher feed rate. To improve the process, more coal samples from different Indian coalfields should be used.', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Annual 2023_proceedings for Hackathon\\\\101.pdf'}),\n",

Knowledge about these is important for assessing the possibility of success for a \\ngeothermal installation, e.g. a geothermal doublet system  in this approach . Due to a lack of respective \\ndata in the Weisweiler region, we use  a combination of literature data from projects in the Netherlands \\nand Belgium, and  analogue samples from outcrops in the vicinity, approximately 5 km to the south.

The pore systems \\nof carbonate rocks are significantly more complex than those of clastic reservoirs,  which leads to a \\nmuch wider range of uncertainties in reservoir characterisation, modelling and flow behaviour. These \\nfactors can result in lower recovery factors due to inadequate reservoir developments. Quantifying the \\nrange of possible uncertainties in  the entire system (reservoir architecture, rock fabric (pore types), \\nwettability variations etc.) and their impact on the flow behaviour during primary, secondary, and \\ntertiary production is hence not only critical for increasing recovery factors, but the re is also the growing \\nneed to train new generations of reservoir engineers and geomodellers in the skill of quantifying \\nuncertainties related to reservoir modelling and production forecasting in carbonate reservoirs.  \\n \\nUncertainties  \\nWe created an undisclosed truth case model followed by two ensemble members: ensemble 1 and \\nensemble 2 (Figure 1 ).

The second challenge is related to solving the underdetermined problem using least-squares\\napproach. Regularization is necessary for this problem to pick one solution among all possible solutions\\nfrom the null space of the problem. The TR method (Fink, 1993), which has a long history in seismic\\napplications for redatuming and source relocation, uses the adjoint of the modeling operator as an ap-\\nproximation of the inverse. This is a rough approximation because the modeling operator is far from a\\nunitary matrix, especially when the medium is dissipative and lossy.\\nIn order to reconstruct a high-resolution (focused) virtual source in heterogeneous media, different meth-\\nods are proposed. For instance, spatiotemporal inverse-ﬁlter or Marchenko method (Wapenaar and Thor-\\nbecke, 2017). The other way is to apply a pseudo-inverse of the modeling operator instead of its adjoint.\\nMontaldo et al. (2004) proposed to iteratively solve the virtual source extraction problem in a least-\\nsquares sense with steepest-descent method. This method, which can be seen as an iteraive TR, removes\\nthe artifacts generated by absorption and other information losses in TR results and improve the resolu-\\ntion of the virtual source iteratively.\\nIn this research, we propose to solve the least-squares virtual source extraction problem in the frequency\\ndomain with the generalized zero-order Tikhonov regularization. Our proposed method is based on a\\nchange of variable in the cost function, such that the waveﬁeld is sought instead of the virtual source\\nwhen the waveﬁeld and the virtual source are related by the wave equation. Accordingly, the waveﬁeld\\nis extracted by solving a better posed sparse-linear system.

       " '84th EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition Further research is needed to constrain the variable controlling the thermal history of the basin (heat flow, erosion, facies distribution, etc.). More accurate structural reconstruction would be also necessary, in order to improve the understanding of the evolution of the basin and its relationship with the source rock maturation and hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation processes. .  Despite these uncertainties, the learnings from the Swiss Foreland Basin indicate that geothermal projects in sedimentary systems should greatly benefit from scenario-based workﬂow approach by incorporating petroleum basin analysis into the feasibility and planning phase of future geothermal exploration wells. This will allow the evaluation of the risks associated with the presence of hydrocarbons in the subsurface in deep geothermal drilling activities, the estimate of a range of volumes of hydrocarbons in order to provide the decision makers the necessary information and knowledge to take informed decision on the project planning and execution.
