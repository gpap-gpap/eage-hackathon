These geotectonic interaction impact seismic activities and undulated subsurface in this region. The study area is surrounded by eastern Himalaya, Arakon Yoma Ranges (AYR), Shillong Massif (SM), Brahmaputra Basin, Kopili Graben and Mikir Hills. The region makes more attention to the geoscientists for its high seismic activity zone and numerous thrust-faults in the region. The aim of the present study is to realize the details associated seismo-tectonic activities for better understanding of the thrust-fault locations with the analysis of Cos(θ) map and positive curvature analysis using ground gravity data of northeast India. Present gravity data interpretations with the above techniques are able to locate the prominent thrust-fault including probable hidden thrust-faults locations. Seismic survey provides the detailed structural setup, however, due to seismic survey limitation in the hilly thrust-fold belt area, gravity data is more appropriate to delineate thrust-fault locations. The derived results are compared with the previously identified known thrust-fault locations and the outcomes are well correlated. The interpretation of Cos(θ) analysis and positive curvature analysis of gravity data add value addition to delineate and identify thrust-fault locations.",6.pdf

In case hydrogen sulphide is present in high concentrations in these geological conditions, this could lead to hazards that are difficult to cope with. The objective is to reveal innovative drilling experience of the first ever exploration well on the Fedynskiy High in the Norwegian Barents Sea, on the borderline of Norway in the Barents Sea. Various methods of drilling and coring in karstified carbonate formations with presence of sour gas in high concentrations have been explored.
During planning, it was demonstrated that modern modelling techniques allow comprehensive analysis of H2S formation process in the reservoir fluid in the Norwegian Barents Sea, especially if both chemical and regional factors are taken into account. This is the first frontier exploration well drilled from a mobile unit on the NCS remotely with risks associated with karst and H2S.
New approaches have been developed to deliver the well in a safe and efficient manner.
Much effort has been used on modeling and regional studies. Experience uncovers new cost-efficient and safe solutions that can be considered in other regions worldwide with similar overall risk picture.",9.pdf

The consequences of that long-term transition for sequestration site selection and modelling are discussed here.  The density inversion from positively to negatively buoyant relative to reservoir water leg that accompanies CO2 dissolution means that synclinal traps are required as part of a long-term dynamic trapping system.  Over these timescales, head gradients in continuous reservoirs should also be considered because the resulting hydrodynamic conditions modify the structural trapping potential, so hydrodynamic rather than hydrostatic structure should be used to define synclinal traps.  Therefore, regional structural mapping plus constraints on hydraulic head gradients should be included in regional geological criteria for CO2 sequestration site portfolio development.",10.pdf

Mechanically scrapping of the asphaltene deposit from the tubing using coil tubing is the most widely used method to mitigate the buildup of asphaltene in the tubing. 
Additionally, the use of fluoropolymer coated tubing’s have shown promising results after having them deployed in one of the deep Marrat wells.

In this paper, we generate Allan maps automatically for seven major faults of the Gullfaks field within a structural uncertainty modelling framework. We first perturb both fault and 
horizon geometry, always keeping the structural model consistent, and generate these juxtaposition maps for each realisation. The area of reservoir to reservoir and reservoir to seal facies is computed for each fault and can help rank and select relevant realisations for geological property modelling and fluid flow simulation. Then, from a set of 20 realisations, we integrate the information from the Allan maps into volumic grids encompassing
all geometric realisations of each fault and compute the probability that a fault is present and leaking in each cell of the grid. This representation is useful in itself to better understand the possible connections between fault blocks in the Gullfaks field, and to provide detailed transmissibility information to flow simulators.",21.pdf

Generally, HPHT wells are classified under a pressure range of 10,000 to 30,000 psia and a temperature range of 350 °F to 500 °F. High density fluid systems have the ability to control the well high pressure for wellbore stability with high density, which contains fewer solids and maintains rheological stability at the HPHT reservoir for minimizing the formation damage and satisfy environmental requirements. This has demanded that new and novel packer and completion fluid designs be developed for low to high combinations HPHT wells. In this paper, developed fluid has shown with high specific gravity and optimum rheology. The calculated apparent viscosity (AV) was found low value which is desired for packer and completion fluid.

This region is a groundwater recharge zone at an outcrop area of the GAS-Guarani Aquifer System in the Paraná Basin. GAS is one of the largest transboundary aquifers in the world with ~1.2 million km² underlying four countries in South America (Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil). Our objective was to map the stratigraphic heterogeneity and hydrogeological characteristics using GPR and Resistivity methods to improve a groundwater conceptual model. GPR results of 200 MHz suggested that near to the main drainage the water table is in a layer of sandy materials. Moving away from the creek, the water table is in a layer with higher clay content and strong reflection, which may be related to a transition zone from recent sediments to the Botucatu Formation residual. Saturated and unsaturated layers were defined in a resistivity profile. Geophysical results showed good agreement with the lithological information from wells and soil samples. The zone of highest hydraulic conductivity was identified near to discharge areas in the Onça creek basin.

For example, the deep thermal methane gas migrates upward, and there is a large amount of free gas in the middle and shallow layers. The gas accumulation in the formation often induce gas chimney. This brings great difficulties to the seismic interpretation of underlying strata. In order to effectively predict the spatial distribution of gas, it is necessary to study the influence of gas accumulation on seismic wave propagation. In this study, in order to simulate gas accumulation in loose rocks in onshore and offshore strata, synthetic sandstones were used for ultrasonic testing. Under different confining pressure and pore pressure, the transmission signals of P- wave and S- wave are measured. The changes of velocity and amplitude with pressure are analyzed. It is found that the increase of pore pressure will lead to the decrease of elastic wave velocity and amplitude when the rock is subjected to a certain confining pressure. This shows that gas chimney can be generated as long as the pore pressure is high enough.",44.pdf

The purpose of surface-consistent correction is to eliminate the influence of complex factors at source and receiver on residual statics, phase, and amplitude of wavelets from the same stable reflector, which is typical deconvolution. Surface-consistent deconvolution can be referred to as a Bayesian estimation problem. However, it requires a great deal of computation, the statistical method should be more efficient. Based on statistics and physical understanding, maximizing the CMP stack has been proved to eliminate residual statics and phase changes, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to explore the non-convex parameter space. Then, under the physical assumption that the energy of wavelets from the same reflection interface changes steadily, the prediction-energy-change equation is introduced. The spatial mutations of amplitudes are corrected by solving a nonlinear equation system. Theoretical and practical applications show the effectiveness.",46.pdf

One of the challenges in the transition area is water bottom silt up to a depth below 1 meter.

Bathymetric measurement shows in the northwest survey area, the seabed depth is shallow up to 1 meter so using sources that vary between explosive and airgun would be more costly and ineffective. Using only an airgun as the source is an efficient option but gunboats cannot pass that depth because of the draft. While the receiver used is nodal with a very flexible ability to the transition environment.

To maintain data in the prospect zone area on the northwest side of the survey, the source line is offset or shifted to a deeper water bottom where the gunboat can still pass through. This method is known as undershoot, which is doing 2D seismic data acquisition where the source and receiver are not in the same line, resulting in a CDP that is not right under the acquisition line. The effectiveness of this method is quite capable of maintaining full fold coverage and describes a good layer to be interpreted starting from the shallowest depth of about 700 milliseconds.",48.pdf

CO2 breakthrough into water producers is a setback of aquifer pumping. By understanding the effect of key aquifer parameters, pressure management strategies and different pattern geometries, we can delay this problem until later stages of the project life. Most of the predictive models available are reservoir dependent and cannot be scaled for evaluating different fields. This project aims to quantify the additional storage efficiency with brine production. Results have shown that with favourable conditions of low mobility ratio, buoyancy viscous equilibrium and large well spacing exist; the breakthrough time can be postponed to more than 60 years and the storage efficiency can reach up to 13%.

The objective is to understand its diagenetic trap potential in a reflux dolomitization region, and to establish a reflux dolomite play concept model.
In the Mid-Late Triassic time, the Arabian plate is mainly characterized by pervasively dolomitized facies interbedded with anhydrites and minor limestone during a period of major marine transgression. In this study, seismic stratigraphic analysis was integrated with paleo-topographic restoration to recognize sedimentary facies of lagoon, inner ramp, and barrier shoal complex. The recognized facies of restricted lagoon and barrier shoals provide ideal depositional environments for reflux dolomitization with hypersaline brines. A conceptual model of reflux dolomitization is utilized to guide dolomite distribution mapping, and to predict dolomite reservoir quality based on the established depositional model. The resulting concept model shows that dolomite reservoir quality enhanced by reflux dolomitization is laterally sealed updip by tight anhydrite deposited in proximal tidal flat and/or sabkha environments. This model was calibrated and validated with well log data. 
Based on enhanced reservoir quality in dolomitized facies, the presence of seal, and the stratigraphic configuration, a reflux dolomite play concept has been established and proposed. Such a configuration of updip tight anhydrite, and lateral downdip porous dolomite reservoirs due to reflux dolomitization processes sets up for potential diagenetic traps.",55.pdf

We present an innovative artificial intelligence framework to track hydrogen fronts in subsurface storage reservoirs based on deep measurement data such as electromagnetics surveys and acoustic impedance, as well as porosity profiles. 
This framework was tested on a Pohokura field simulation study for hydrogen storage incorporating interwell deep electromagnetic surveys, acoustic impedance, and porosity profiles. Expert processing was also included in the pre-processing stage to remove inconsistent measurements in the training data.  Overall, all regression trees showed a high resemblance to the original hydrogen front. However, the tree with the smallest minimum leaf size, which is the ultra-fine tree, has the highest accuracy and certainty. As for the computational time, the coarse tree is considered to be the fastest. Comparison of the outcomes is discussed and illustrated.  
This AI framework represents an innovative approach to support hydrogen fronts tracking for hydrogen storage, by combining deep measurement data such as electromagnetic surveys, acoustic impedance, and porosity profiles with an artificial intelligence framework.",61.pdf

Large scale hydrogen production facilities have been constructed in order to satisfy the growing demand for hydrogen derived products. 
A major current process to generate hydrogen is autothermal reforming that utilizes oxygen, steam and carbon dioxide together with methane (derived from natural gas) in order to produce hydrogen.
A crucial challenge in the optimization of the hydrogen production process while ensuring to minimize the overall carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, is to optimize both natural gas production and CO2 sequestration. 
The framework was examined on the New Zealand McKee reservoir structure model with multiple producing wells and a separate CO2 sequestration reservoir. Simulated historical production and injection data were generated for a time period of three years for various production and injection levels. 
A robust global optimization approach, based on an artificial intelligence genetic optimization, allows for simultaneously optimization of an injection pattern and uncertainty quantification. Results indicate  potential for significant reduction in required carbon dioxide, while maximizing hydrogen production.
The developed deep learning framework represents an innovative approach towards enhancing sustainability optimizing hydrogen production. The framework can be easily expanded to other types of reservoirs and production environments.",62.pdf

The joint inversion of multi-modal data can produce enhanced subsurface images of the physical property distributions, which enhances our ability to explore natural resources. One effective method of joint inversion is based on the Gramian constraint. This technique enforces the relationships between different model parameters during the inversion process. We demonstrate that the Gramian can be interpreted as a determinant of the covariance matrix between different physical models representing subsurface geology in the framework of the probabilistic approach to inverse theory. This interpretation enables us to use all the power of the modern probability theory and statistics in developing new methods for the joint inversion of multi-modal geophysical data.

It is generally thought that few or no located MEs reflects poor hydraulic fracturing results and that more located MEs indicate a better result, but the variability in rupture behavior at different rupture scales is ignored. This paper focuses on the rupture characteristics of shale by microseismic monitoring. Because seismic wave energy is related to the rupture scale and stronger MEs are generated by larger ruptures along pre-existing fractures, fault damage zones or isolated small faults, these slippages may cause casing deformation, and the connected fracture networks may result in fluid seepage. A large number of weak MEs are ignored during fracturing because too little energy is released from small ruptures to be effectively detected, but they usually indicate a fracture network and greatly contribute to gas production in the long term. Therefore, ruptures in shale generally occur from the microscale to macroscale and express similar rupture behavior at each scale but result in different seismic characteristics, located ME distributions, fracture evolutions and engineering effects.",68.pdf

Our approach progressively models coherent seismic signal during the interpolation, where each stage focuses on different modes, starting with the strongest signal. Different sparsity-promoting prior information, to enhance the separability of the current strongest amplitude mode, is exploited to optimise the final interpolation output.

A final merged velocity model was built through two iterations of the leading-edge technology of Well-Constrained Tomography (WCT), supported by detailed well ties analysis. 
In this part of the Carnarvon Basin, velocity modeling and depth conversion are deemed to be challenging due to presence of complex water bottom topography, heterogeneous tertiary carbonates and complex overburden channels and canyons. The study was designed to reduce uncertainty associated with seismic interpretation, depth conversion, prospect generation, well placement and resources estimation. WCT is a ray-based/inversion approach to tie well data to a velocity model and is based on tomographic principles in which depth errors are converted to time errors along normal rays to minimise the error in the velocity model. 
To quantitatively measure uncertainties around the velocity model, two iterations of WCT velocity model building were performed. The uncertainties associated with the first iteration of WCT were quantified through “Blind Well Testing” at 22 wells. The second iteration of WCT with integration of 86 wells was performed to create the final velocity model.

Compressibility is the reciprocal of bulk modulus, and it proves to be very sensitive to saturation changes within the reservoir, documented in earlier work, see Gisolf, 2016. Historically, workflows like Near vs Far amplitudes or linear inversions have failed to address the issue mainly due to the relative lack of sensitivity to saturation, coupled with the presence of multiple scattering in the area that tends to take its toll on the far offsets.

Examples of such reflections include artificial reflections from the boundaries of an imposed computational domain and reflections from high velocity contrasts defining a boundary (e.g., top of salt) that cause unwanted imaging artifacts in reverse-time migration. 

We propose a way of suppressing reflections from a selected boundary by performing two experiments using acoustic modelling parameterised by velocity and vector reflectivity. The velocity model is fixed for both experiments. The first simulation forces each component of the vector reflectivity to be +1 at the selected boundary, and the second simulation forces a value of -1. Averaging of the wavefields from these two independent simulations performs the suppression of reflections from the selected boundary. It will work for energy reflected from either side of the selected boundary.

This basic description of averaging of two-simulations is limited to suppression of energy that has reflected from the selected boundary an odd number of times. It is possible through averaging more simulations and encoding the selected boundary with patches of +1 and -1 reflectivity values to suppress further types of high/even order reflections.",85.pdf

The feasibility of a gasification process is driven by two major factors i.e. gas yield and gas composition. Conventionally, these factors are tested, analysed and interpreted for a limited number of feed coal samples for respective gasifiers, where the gasifier performance highly depends on the its controlled environment as well as feed coal’s petrographic (maturity) and chemical (grade) properties. The Fluidized Bed gasifier has an overall advantage of handling high-ash feed coal at homogeneous temperature profile maintained below its ash melting point. Through present study, an attempt has been made to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for learning from feed coal properties and thereafter prediction of gasifier performance in terms of carbon conversion and concentration of gases produced (CO, CO2 and H2).

The simple definition of polarity in the frequency domain and the non-stationary properties of time domain methods draw attention to time-frequency (TF) methods owing to their ability to localize the data in both time and frequency domains. Since geophysical data is typically acquired by 3-component sensors and is characterized by the simultaneous arrival of numerous wave types, an effective TF decomposition that takes all components into account at the same time is required. Therefore, we improved the polarization filter introduced in (Pinnegar 2006) by using the 3-component sparse adaptive ST algorithm. The proposed polarization filter is a potential tool for wavefield separation due to its invertibility and resolution flexibility. The superiority of the proposed method over the adaptive ST method in extracting Rayleigh waves is shown using earthquake data to calculate the polarization attributes in the time-frequency domain.",108.pdf

The proposed CCS site for the field is the depleted clastic gas reservoirs in a nearby offshore area. Thorough monitoring is required to ensure a successful CCS and long-term storage. One of the standard methods is the use of Time-lapse seismic. The concept of using seismic data to monitor the CO2 movement within the storage has been widely used, such as in the Sleipner field. However, most of the storage sites are aquifers, in which the effect of gas on seismic is expected to be high. This study is conducted as a feasibility to determine the effectiveness of using time-lapse seismic data to monitor CCS in a depleted gas reservoir. The synthetic seismic forward model was generated and measured. The study has suggested a relatively low seismic response if the CO2 migrates within the reservoir. However, leakage or unanticipated CO2 movement outside the predefined container is likely to be observable. The study has shown that the use of time-lapse seismic for CO2 monitoring may have limitations. Nonetheless, time-lapse seismic is still considered an essential part of CCS operation as it is crucial to detect the onset of CO2 leakage. Observation of unplanned CO2 migration into the aquifer is also important information to understand reservoir heterogeneity and to update CO2 injection plans accordingly.",118.pdf

Results showed that the carbonated water flooding produced additional 15.5% of original oil in core (OOIC) beyond the waterflooding, indicating that CO2 effectively diffuses into the oil after the carbonated water injection. This helps reduce oil viscosity and favorably improves oil mobility. After the carbonated water flood, slight rock dissolution was observed at the inlet end face of the core plug. The CT image analysis revealed that the dissolution was very shallow, which suggests that the carbonated water flood for carbonates may not cause evident impact on reservoir permeability. A benchmark test of hot water flooding obtained an incremental oil recovery of 21.0% OOIC.

Horizontal slice (stratal slice) is useful to avoid pitfalls of subseismic cloinoforms in current data sets.",131.pdf

Eni was a forerunner and main actor throughout the entire exploration history of the province.
The basin historical creaming curve represents several flat time-intervals indicating maturity of the plays explored until that moment, followed by renewal associated to new play discovery.

Medium-high maturity shale oil is considered as the key target of unconventional resources in China in the near future 
However, there is no generally agreed upon determining oil content as the most important parameter for shale oil resource evaluation. To understand this effect, we used full-closure coring shale samples from Songliao Basin in eastern China to perform four sets of experiments on splits of the same samples: T1—T2 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), Dean Stark, TG-GC (thermogravimetry-gas chromatographic) and Rock-Eval. The data set shows that the T1—T2 NMR and Dean Stark data generally agree in the amount of oil (normalized to the size of the sample), while the TG-GC data shows significantly less oil, and the Rock-Eval are the least. The sample preparation has an important influence on the oil content measured. The oil content of block samples is significantly higher than powder. T1—T2 NMR can get reliable values, with fast, non-destructive and weak heterogeneity. 
It is suggested to take T1—T2 NMR as the analytical method used to measure oil content for liquids-rich shale. A relationship between oil content correction coefficient and Ro can be determined and used to correct pyrolysis S1 (conventional coring) to original oil content in place, which is crucial for the exploration and exploitation of continental shale oil with oil-prone organic matter.",143.pdf

According to traditional techniques, faults are identified by estimating the characteristics from seismic reflection continuities or discontinuities. The difficulty of labelling a seismic image with 1’s (one’s) on faults and 0’s (zeros) elsewhere is what we refer to as the binary image segmentation problem of fault identification. Using a supervised convolutional neural network, we train the network with synthetic data with corresponding fault masks, because a binary fault image is highly imbalanced between faults and non-faults. We have used a class-balanced binary cross-entropy loss function to adjust the imbalance so that the network is not trained or converged to predict only zeros. After training, the network automatically learns to segment faults in a real field dataset (Netherlands F3 offshore). This study indicates that the neural network can predict faults from seismic images much more accurately and efficiently.

However, the use of the critical porosity model in the derivation of the effective pore-fluid bulk modulus reflection coefficient limits its application to hydrate reservoirs. Therefore, we have re-expressed the reflection coefficient equation for the effective fluid bulk modulus using the consolidation parameter and defined it as the fluid indicator of the hydrate reservoir. The model analysis shows that the accuracy of the novel fluid indicator meets the needs of the pre-stack seismic inversion, while the consolidation parameter can evaluate the consolidation and compaction of the rocks and is more meaningful for shallow subsea reservoirs.

Through dynamic model building, one of the challenges is the uncertainty in the volume of historical water injection at the flank area. This attribute indicates the overall water saturation trend but also this fluid distribution, which is mostly consistent with this dynamic model. Moreover, the past reservoir surveillance data of this water saturation area support this attribute rather than the model. Such findings give us a strong basis to revise in next-generation model.

This simple, easily applied approach can be used to quantify fine-scale stratigraphic heterogeneity within any continuous numerical datasets such as well logs.

Porosity and permeability increase as thermal stressing temperature increases from room temperature to 700 °C. In-situ measurements also revealed a decrease of P-wave velocity of about 50% between room temperature and 450°C. The permeability of thermally stressed samples decreases by about one order of magnitude during triaxial loading to the peak stress, due to the closure of pre-existing microcracks, and then increases following the formation of a macroscopic fracture. Permeability then remains more-or-less constant as strain is accommodated by sliding on the resultant shear fracture.

However, the conventional CS method is greatly affected by noise, and the effective expansion of frequency bandwidth information can only be realized in the case of a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, CS denoising theory is introduced into the optimization solution function to constrain the inversion process of the estimated reflection coefficient, and then, the frequency bandwidth of the original data is expanded by extracting the high and low frequency information of the inverted reflection coefficient. It has been proved by multiple real data processing results that the objective function of estimating the reflection coefficient constrained by denoising based on CS theory can improve the anti-noise interference ability of the inversion process and expand the high and low frequency information well in the case of a low SNR.",162.pdf

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveys offer a cheap, fast, and sustainable method with a low CO2 footprint to obtain an accurate orthomosaic image of the area. Cloth simulation filter, random forest algorithm, and conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) represent a spectrum of method complexity commonly utilized to classify land cover from UAV-based ortho imageries. This study investigates the applicability of the three abovementioned methods for land cover classification using UAV-based imageries tailored for seismic data acquisition in the arid area. With minor imprecision, CGAN outperforms the random forest algorithm and the cloth simulation filter in terms of accuracy. CGAN is exceptionally accel in classifying small features in densely-populated areas.

First, a three-dimensional grid is built from a structural framework. Then well log and seismic data are upscaled to the grid cell resolution, and properties are modelled using geostatistical techniques that require inferring parameters (e.g., the variogram model) from these upscaled data. The grid is built at a user-specified scale and resolution; modifying the grid scale to focus on a different area of interest, or the grid resolution to capture additional geological detail, requires starting the geostatistical modelling workflow again from scratch. As a result, static geomodels are built for a unique purpose, creating silos between disciplines, and leading to inconsistencies among geomodels. Also, locking the grid resolution early in the modelling process results in the conservative choice of fine resolution grids to incorporate detailed geological features in case they would impact project forecasts, making the modelling process unnecessarily complex and time consuming. 
A new grid-less modelling approach, named Scalable Earth Modeling, is presented. It enables fully integrated and consistent multi-scale modelling while allowing geomodelers to add geological detail only when needed, based on the accuracy of the forecasts required for making sound project decisions.",173.pdf

Diversity sampling heuristics is based on clustering while the uncertainty heuristic is based on data RMSE. The adaptive, physics-driven learning process uses evidence from field data as generated by an inversion process to provide real-world proxies to the ML training and ensure optimal generalization for field data applications. The dynamic learning model is provided by an iterative feedback loop between the inversion process and a ML system progressively adapting to the characteristics of the field data. Convergence metrics is developed to monitor the flattening of the learning curve while ensuring the convergence of the data misfit from the physics-based procedure.

This study divides the complete stress-strain curve into three stages and acquires corresponding BSI based on the brittle failure evolution. Then a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is proposed to determine the contribution weight coefficients of BSI at each stage to the brittle behaviour of shale, where a comparison matrix is constructed based on the evolution of energy accumulating and releasing during the loading to avoid the experience lacking and consistency issues. Experimental evaluations of two sets of reservoir shale show that the new model can effectively indicate the variation of brittleness with affecting factors, such as brittle-plastic mineral content, porosity, burial depth, and confining pressure, which demonstrate its accuracy and superiorities. Comparative analysis of the published models reveals that the new model has stronger sensitivity to the buried depth.  Furthermore, the proposed model, combined with the controlled artificial shale, indicates that the brittleness decreases with the kerogen content.

The main objective is to identify the solid surface wettability accurately and faster using crushed rock powder. Conventional methods to quantify the solid surface wettability are either to measure the contact angle on core slice or to measure the wettability index of the whole core. For optical contact angle method, when there is ultra-low interfacial tension between crude oil and surfactants, oil drop tends to spread on the core surface, making the contact angle measurement impossible. The wettability index method is usually time-consuming. Using Washburn method, the average wettability property of crushed rock powder can be precisely determined. By controlling the powder particle size and packing density, the measurement of contact angle is reproducible. A number of tests were conducted using this method to study the effect of surfactants on the wettability of solid surface.

Here, we present a fluid inclusion technique to measure salinity that can be used as input for Sw calculation.

In Reservoir A, the latest assemblage of secondary inclusions was trapped in quartz approx. 200 ka. Salinity of the aqueous fluid trapped in the secondary inclusions is approx. 15-20 ppt which is interpreted to represent the same salinity of present-day formation water. Such measurements allowed us to greatly reduce uncertainty of salinity value for Sw calculation. Reservoir B, in which salinity is known from reservoir fluid samples, was used as testing case. Here, salinity of the latest secondary inclusions in quartz overgrowth ranges from 49.6 to 60.1 ppt which overlaps with salinity measured from reservoir flow test spanning from 45 to 60 ppt.

The key motivation has been automation, consistency of output, and quality improvements. We present separate workflows for both pressure and particle motion records that use deep learning to directly attenuate the noise from the records. The heart of the workflows is a convolutional neural network called real image denoising network (RIDNet). The current workflows use a single RIDNet model with exact structure for both pressure and particle motion records to attenuate incoherent noise in the bandwidth where most of the noise exists. Both models were trained using data recorded in the field with supervised learning where the desired outputs were produced by previously developed machine learning based workflows.  The new workflows have been extensively validated using records from surveys acquired with different survey geometry, water depth and sea conditions. The validation process confirms that there is no need for workflow modification or re-training of the models. Therefore, the workflows are automated and do not require user interaction.",225.pdf

The social factor around employment effects and consequences for the local communities in mining-intensive regions that are experiencing a shift away from coal is often forgotten. Even though this consideration plays a decisive role in the development of regions. Hereby, the EU projects POTENTIALS and GreenJOBS focus on the various components, develop business models for site-specific reuse options in former mining regions, and are dedicated to creating new (green) jobs. Together with different partners around Europe, these projects benefit from diverse knowledge transfer and experiences. First results show a high number of possible scenarios for business models.

In this study, we offer an isotropic double-solid-matrix model to characterize its properties by regarding nodular hydrate grain as an individual solid matrix in addition to the mineral one. First, the dry matrix moduli of two constituents, hydrate and mineral phase, are calculated separately. Then we adopt the Hashin–Shtrikman low bound to obtain the dry composite matrix moduli.

Well data from the F3-block, Dutch North Sea, are used for calculating three synthetic models: homogeneous and heterogeneous wedge, and a fault model. The ML methods used are Lasso-regression, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks. Other parameters such as variation of well locations are also tested.

The 2D predictions show that well-locations are important for determining porosity in the homogeneous wedge. The use of geologic timelines improve the prediction significantly when noise is added to the synthetic seismic section. Random Forest and KNN perform well in the homogeneous wedge, Neural network works well in the heterogeneous wedge, and Random Forest narrowly outperforms the other methods in the fault model.

Conventional strategies directly apply smoothing operators at each full waveform inversion iteration. Numerous of operators have been proposed in the literature, from Gaussian operators to more evolved structure preserving Laplacian operators. The former are easy to implement but might destroy the structural information embedded in the gradient. The latter require an external source of information related to the structure to be preserved. We propose to use an anisotropic diffusion filter which can directly enhance the structure of the gradient without using external prior information. We extend the 2D method presented at 2022 EAGE meeting in Madrid to 3D, use an adapted discretization scheme which guarantees numerical stability, and apply it to a 3D field data from the North Sea. We compare the results of inversion up to 10 Hz between a Gaussian smoothing and our anisotropic diffusion smoothing. The enhancement of the resolution and the structural coherence is striking, making full wavefield images much easier to interpret geologically. We believe this technique could be applied to a wide variety of field data in the future.",258.pdf

However, the sedimentary microfacies are hard to determine due to the lack of core and thin section.Therfore, the quantitative identification of sedimentary microfacies in the eastern margin of the Pre-Caspian basin has been carried out by using two key technologies and good results have been achieved. The first technology is the quantitative identification technology of complex biological limestone logging.The second technique is quantitative identification of sedimentary microfacies.Nine lithologic sensitive curves are selected to determine logging response characteristic values of 10 types of limestone, and cluster analysis model is optimized for quantitative identification of 10 types of lithology. Foraminifera content has a high correlation with energy skewness, 30Hz frequency division energy, -90o phase component RMS, root mean square amplitude.According to the prediction results of limestone structural components and sedimentary environment, the intra-platform beach subfacies in the open platform of KT-II can be divided into five sedimentary microfacies: algal beach, foraminiferal beach, bioclastic beach, sandy beach and intertidal sea. Through the study of diagenetic sequences of reservoir, we can draw the conclusion that the main controlling factors of reservoir development are quasi-contemporaneous dissolution of favorable intra-platform shoal subfacies and dissolution of unconformity surface.

Nevertheless, even if Eni’s approach to the study of fractures networks (FNs) was successfully applied on the main fractured reservoirs operated by Eni, the FNs modelling still has intrinsic limits.

Three tectono-diagenetic events were identified through U-Pb geochronology, petrographic and geochemical investigations: Barremian to Aptian, Albo-Cenomanian and Campanian to Maastrichtian. They reveal a diagenetic evolution characterised by an initially strong hydrothermal overprint that progressively attained geothermal equilibrium under deep-burial conditions during the late Cretaceous. These diagenetic episodes are not necessarily coeval with magmatic events but indeed coeval with basin-scale tectonic events linked to changes in the associated tectonic regime, thus characterising events of structural diagenesis.

Different from random noise, erratic noise follows non-Gaussian distribution and has high amplitude, which is a challenge to the conventional denoising frameworks based on deep learning (DL). The computational cost of the commonly used supervised-learning-based framework is unaffordable when processing multi-dimensional data, such as seismic data in more than three-dimensional space. We propose an unsupervised-learning framework with a multi-branch attention mechanism to attenuate the erratic and random noise in 3-D seismic data. The propposed network can adaptively attenuate noise in multi-dimensional seismic data without the need to manually generate labels to train the network. In the encoding stage, several multi-branch attention blocks are used to extract significant features and reduce the data dimension. The proposed network integrates global features of waveforms extracted from multiple branches in a weighted way to enhance attention to significant features, thus obtaining a global and comprehensive representation of weights. In the decoding stage, we use several stacked multi-branch attention blocks to reconstruct features. To enhance the migration ability of shallow-level to deep-level features, we add some skip connections in the corresponding encoder and decoder.

However, those surveys come with new challenges compared to streamer or cable acquisitions. One of the main challenges is that most nodes are autonomous and cannot communicate with external devices to obtain frequent, exact GPS timing during the production period. Instead, nodes use an internal clock to time the recorded data, which over the course of the production period will deviate from GPS time for any node. This is known as clock drift and is usually compensated for in the processing of the data. How well different correction methods work depends on the stability and predictability of the drift. We have conducted a series of experiments aiming to characterize the main drift elements of CSAC clocks used in some commercial OBN, namely disciplining, aging and temperature. We run controlled drift tests with and without disciplining for 60, 75 and 91 days respectively, using 100 nodes. We show that nodes without clock disciplining can be equally well drift corrected as their disciplined counterparts. We further show that residuals from linear correction can be fully attributed to aging as a dominant effect – there is no chaotic behaviour in our recorded data. In fact, we observe that the clocks are very stable and to a high degree predictable. In a separate experiment, we also investigated the effects of a temperature changes. The results show that this is causing mostly a small linear drift element which the linear corrections are taking care of.",279.pdf

The study analyses a fault in the vicinity of the appraisal well 7324/8-3. The fault shows an inner structure which is typical for several faults in this field. A high-resolution seismic cube with a frequency range of 8Hz – 180Hz (-10dB points) is available for the study. The well logs sonic, shear-sonic and density allow to calculate the impedance log and the Young modulus which can be used as an indicator of the brittleness of the rock. Post-stack seismic inversion is applied to the seismic cube to analyze the fault facies.

Above the Stø formation the fault shows inner facies of low acoustic impedance embedded in elongated patched of high impedance values. The low impedance values are not supported by the host rocks and could be explained by gas in the fault zone. The lower part of the fault shows a chaotic pattern.

A seismic attribute analysis indicates that the fault is made up of several small faults defining a zone which widens with increasing depth. Also seismic layers of low Young modulus derived from the well show less faults than brittle zones.

Aiming to prevent the emergency situations and avoid economic and social problems, landslide monitoring studies were carried out on the sites of historical and cultural heritage in Kyiv (the National Museum of the History of Ukraine, Lysa Hora and Fomin Botanical Garden) involving a rational complex of instrumental observations based on Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) technique, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and thermography data.
Following the conducted study, the high informative value of the complex of ERT, GPR and IRT methods for the local forecasting of landslide hazard was confirmed, as they contribute to the detailed study of the geometry of the landslide body, determine the level of water content in sediments of landslide-prone slopes, and also assess the potential formation of the landslide processes.

Predicting the petrophysical properties of rocks from seismic data is challenging because the relationship between petrophysical properties of rocks and their seismic response is more complex and hidden than the relationship between elastic properties (velocity, impedance, etc.) and seismic response. The deep learning methods have advantages in mapping the complex nonlinear relationship between Petrophysical properties and seismic data. However, there are many challenges that might prevent deep learning algorithms from finding a proper mapping that can be generalized for an entire survey area. In this work, we proposed a new deep learning scheme for predicting petrophysical properties. The proposed scheme includes three parts: extended labeled dataset, multi-task inversion neural network architecture, and physical guidance loss. Through the numerical model test, we believe that the extended labeled dataset can significantly reduce the errors caused by insufficient training, the multi-attribute input with the multi-task inversion neural network architecture can provide more constraint information, and the physical guidance loss term can effectively reduce the multi-solution of prediction results.",287.pdf

Asphaltene structure consists of hydrocarbons and various heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, S). These active functional groups in asphaltene structure are the main reason for asphaltene adsorption onto rock’s surface. Development of effective asphaltene precipitation requires a deep understanding of the interaction of asphaltene and reservoir rock surface. Nano-inhibitors are a proper candidate for asphaltene precipitation inhibitors owing to their small size (&lt;100 nm) and stability in porous media. Nanoparticles adsorb the asphaltene in the oil medium decreasing the rate of asphaltene accumulation and consequently precipitation of asphaltene onto surface. The type of nanoparticles, surface area, chemistry, and thermodynamic conditions are the main parameters affecting the amount of asphaltene adsorption onto nanoparticle surfaces. Hence, it is necessary to select suitable nanoparticles considering the nature of asphaltene and thermodynamic conditions. This research work is an attempt to fill a research gap in the literature on the amount of asphaltene adsorption on calcite as the main reservoir rock surface in carbonates in presence of nanoparticles. The main aims of the present research work include assessing the performance of MgO and NiO nanoparticles on preventing asphaltene precipitation onto calcite surfaces using sophisticated analytical tools including X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS)-NEXSA and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

In this work, we split the inverse Hankel transform into two integrals.

To enable 4D interpretation over the full reservoir area, TotalEnergies Upstream Companies Nigeria acquired in 2017, prior to first oil production in December 2018, an ocean-bottom node (OBN) baseline (BL) survey. Acquisition of the first monitor (M1) survey took place in 2021. This case study describes how OBN-specific processing algorithms and associated 4D QCs overcame some acquisition challenges and delivered a high-fidelity 4D product to accurately interpret the reservoir changes. The 4D attributes show excellent repeatability with normalized root-mean-square values below 6%, low level of 4D noise and high resolution 4D signal. The 4D seismic data were of sufficient quality to enable elastic inversion and interpret the reservoir changes over the entire survey area.

Continuous monitoring via acquisition of new 4D surveys is planned for the next years. The project established 4D OBN workflows should facilitate standalone processing of the new vintages and therefore reduce the turnaround time between acquisition and interpretation of the results.",313.pdf

The Sleipner CO2 monitoring programme is a repeated seismic survey acquired in the Norwegian North Sea to monitor the evolution of the injected CO2 plume in the subsurface and identify possible geohazards. Robust quantitative interpretation of the Sleipner dataset remains a challenge due to the non-repeatable noise between surveys and the tuning effects present in the data. In this work, we propose to apply a 4D joint inversion-segmentation approach with the aim of estimating the acoustic impedance models for the baseline and monitor datasets as well as classifying their difference into user-defined time-lapse classes. Introducing a segmentation constraint in the inversion process is beneficial in that it enforces the difference between the inverted models to belong to a predefined set of classes, minimizing the non-repeatable noise and enhancing genuine 4D changes. Our results are superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art least-squares inversion techniques and pave the way for an improved understanding of CO2 migration in the subsurface.",315.pdf

Post-stack impedance information is an important information for reservoir characterization, and how to predict high-resolution impedance information using available information is particularly important for unconventional reservoir prediction.

The core problem of deep learning is the construction of training datasets, but existing methods often lead to problems such as overfitting due to the lack of training datasets. In addition, existing network frameworks are often used to solve a single problem, but in fact the network has the ability to solve multiple problems. In this paper, we construct a network framework that can perform both processing and inversion, and train the network using a convolutional model to construct a training dataset. The network implements high-resolution processing and impedance inversion of seismic data. We introduce a physical model and an initial model to constrain the network training so as to reduce the problems such as overfitting.

Moreover, the massive amounts of seismic data deem the manual interpretation process practically impossible. Thus, researchers typically resort to automatic algorithms (such as using machine learning models) to aid the manual interpretation of the full seismic data. Nonetheless, many of these algorithms demand considerable labeled data to build a model capable of achieving satisfactory performance. Alternatively, we propose a self-supervised framework to alleviate the need for large amounts of labeled data. Our approach is based on masked autoencoders using vision transformers. Similar to attributes traditionally extracted from seismic data for use in seismic interpretation, masked autoencoders can learn valuable representations of seismic data that can aid in the labeling process. A 3D marine seismic survey from the New Zealand government, called Parihaka, is used to validate our proposed procedure for the task of facies classification.

Diving-wave time-lapse analyses offer a complementary tool to reflection time-lapse analyses and have the potential for improving CO₂ detection for multi-layer plume geometries. We present an analytical approximation to the diving-wave time-lapse delay due to a thin layer of CO₂ encased in a sedimentary medium where the velocity increases linearly with depth. The approximation can be used to gain insight on CO₂ detection limits using diving waves and can aid the design of seismic acquisition systems for CO₂ storage monitoring. The diving-wave delay can be exploited by advanced monitoring methods such as Full-waveform inversion (FWI) to improve CO₂ migration monitoring. We compare the benefits of using different parts of the wave-field via acoustic FWI for CO₂ thin-layer detection on a multi-layer setting. The inversion using diving waves and reflections is able to reconstruct the low-frequency trend for the thin CO₂ layers, enabling detection and recovery of the true depth for all layers in the plume. The low-frequency reconstruction is not possible with reflection data only, resulting in poorer detection for deep complex regions within the plume, and yielding a depth increasing error in the depth of the CO₂ layers.",320.pdf

Structural analyses of the stability of complex geometry faults and fractures are typically performed under static conditions using specialist structural geology software which does not account for dynamic fluid behaviour over the course of injection. Dynamic changes in fluid pressure from injection can be effectively modelled using numerical reservoir simulators however these tools do not account for complex geometries that fault and fracture surfaces exhibit.

In this study we overcome this modelling gap in a novel manner by linking, in real-time, dynamic reservoir simulation with structural modelling tools, analysing the response of complex geometry structures to dynamic stress conditions. The methodology is applied to two carbon capture and storage case studies. which showcase the predictive power of this integrated methodology and how it can be used to determine if a CO2 injection strategy is likely to result in fault/fracture instability.",322.pdf

Only one well has been drilled in these basins (Pomboo-1, 2007), which are otherwise only constrained by a widely-spaced grid of 2D data. Classical seismic facies techniques and regional geological analysis have been used to identify potential sand-prone intervals in both the Cretaceous and Palaeogene sections. In order to establish the possibility of eventual economic production from these potential reservoir-prone intervals, it was necessary to estimate the likely ranges of static reservoir parameters such as porosity, permeability, net pay, net/gross and possible dynamic parameters such as recovery factor, production rates (% of oil or gas produced in peak year) and oil recovery per unit volume of the reservoir. A searchable database of worldwide deepwater reservoirs (the Cossey Deepwater Database) was used to define sets of analogue fields for offshore Somalia. The use of this extensive and well-parameterized database has permitted us to compare and share best practices; be comfortable that the ranges of predicted parameters are reasonable; investigate alternative models (What If…); constrain the data input to economic models; define the constraints on the business opportunity; capture the degree of uncertainty, and quickly ascend the learning curve.",324.pdf

This is a multidimensional surface that defines the misfit, or fitness, between modelled and observed data over the entire parameter search-space. By characterising the topology of the fitness landscape, we aim to guide the optimisation strategy and increase confidence in the models.  This paper presents a new method for fitness landscape analysis (FLA) and compares it with two methods from other research areas. They were evaluated using a well-known set of benchmark functions and applied to a synthetic, full-field reservoir model. We found that the fitness landscapes of ASHM problems are smooth, low-lying surfaces with many local or global minima, which may explain the uncertainty and low confidence of the models seen by industry. The findings of this work support our hypothesis that FLA may offer a more profound understanding of ASHM, and provide the motivation for further research and development.",326.pdf

The modelling results and the measured P-wave velocities under anisotropic stress conditions showed good agreement for all incident angles, demonstrating that the model can be used to estimate P-wave velocity in any direction given arbitrary anisotropic stress conditions based on the velocities measured under hydrostatic stress conditions. Furthermore, the results suggest that stress-induced velocity anisotropy has a linear relationship with initial cumulative crack porosity, and rocks with higher stress sensitivity of velocity have higher velocity anisotropy under anisotropic stress conditions.",336.pdf

Blind deconvolution is an effective method for solving the problem mentioned above. Compared with deconvolution, spectral inversion reduces the tuning effect and calculates more accurate reflectivity based on the odd-even decomposition theorem of reflection coefficients. Therefore, we combined blind deconvolution and spectral inversion and proposed blind spectral inversion. Given an initial wavelet, we calculate the reflectivity based on spectral inversion and update the wavelet for the next iteration. The blind spectral inversion method inherits the wavelet robustness of blind deconvolution and high resolution of spectral inversion, which is suitable for reflectivity inversion. Applications to synthetic and field seismic datasets demonstrate that the blind spectral inversion method can accurately calculate the reflectivity even if there is an error in wavelet extraction.",339.pdf

In order to improve the horizontal continuity of seismic data, and further improve the subsequent seismic data processing and inversion accuracy, fast and effective reconstruction methods have important practical significance for irregular seismic data. In this paper, the irregular data reconstruction technology based on complex cepstrum and dynamic threshold is proposed, which mainly uses complex cepstrum method to determine the initial value of the trace to be reconstructed and reduce the noise of the reconstructed data. At the same time, the three-dimensional curvelet transform based on dynamic threshold is used to determine the dividing point between noise and effective signal's curvelet coefficient, which can effectively suppress the noise, protect the effective signal, and improve the S/N (signal-to-noise) of the reconstructed data.

The sedimentary fill is typically Oligo-Miocene and younger, lacustrine at the base, and becoming fluvio-deltaic to shallow marine in the younger section. A possible package of Mesozoic strata may be preserved. However, there is no direct evidence from well penetrations and core studies to indicate the true age of this package.

While most fields are concentrated in the centre of the analogue basins, a considerable number also lie outside those areas, particularly in the southern Malay and West Natuna basins, suggestive of long-range migration out of the principal kitchen areas.

However, algorithms for sparse inversion are hindered by slow convergence, meaning that a solution of acceptable quality requires a large number of iterations. One of the most powerful solvers is the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). The algorithm proceeds by alternatingly performing a gradient step and a thresholding step with a fixed threshold, accelerated by Nesterov acceleration. Recently Li and Liu (2022), introduced an algorithm called adaptive FISTA (AFISTA), where a seemingly heuristic adaptive thresholding strategy is used. In this work, we show that this adaptive thresholding can be justified theoretically as a simple modification of the weighted l1 scheme proposed by Candes et al. (2008). This allows us to interpret AFISTA as a non-convex algorithm that approximates the l0 in an IRLS-type fashion, and show that the reweighting is not limited to the particular algorithm used. Our new theoretically understanding has important implications in that it can explain the success of this solver for the problem of spiky deconvolutionm as well as highlight some of the pittfalls that may arise when applying this algorithm to more general settings. Moreover, we extend this idea to Total-Variation regularization, which can be solved by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) or primal-dual algorithms. We conclude by applying the proposed algorithm to two geophysical inverse problems, namely interpolation of seismic data and post-stack inversion.",352.pdf

In this study, a representative aquifer, which was historically used for storing natural gas, is examined for underground H2 storage. With the use of full-compositional simulations at the field scale, we analysed the key factors influencing fluid mixing between H2 and the remaining natural gas, which drives the H2 purity during back production. In addition, we tested different operational strategies, such as varying the injection timing of the cushion gas and the volume ratio between cushion gas and working gas, with the aim of improving the H2 recovery performance. A certain amount of sacrificial H2 is necessary to sustain the quality of the back-produced gas when repurposing the natural gas storage field for H2 storage. The timing of the injection of such sacrificial H2 also plays an important role in driving recovery performance.",371.pdf

The data acquisition was challenged due to the proximity to the mine and ongoing drilling adjacent to the profiles. It also was challenged by a thick, penetrative and varying in-situ weathered layer, reducing the overall quality of the data. Two types of seismic sources were tested, a SIST source and explosives at depths of 9-12 m. Given the attenuative nature of the weathering layer, the explosive sources provided better quality data than the SIST source. However, given the higher fold of the SIST data, it was possible to combine both datasets and obtain reasonable refraction static solutions and information on the nature of the near-surface weathered layer and subsurface structures along the profiles. Sources located on wetter parts of the profiles show better quality data, implying the acquisition could have benefited more if it was done in a wet season in the area. An overall anticlinal structure is interpreted from the data, as well as several faults that indicate a complex stratigraphy in the area. Given the challenges encountered and overall poor signal-to-noise ratio, we recommend more seismic surveys and parameter testing in the region to optimize the acquisition parameters and to make the method successful for future exploration purposes given its world-class mineral endowed potential and in this accelerated era of energy transition.",372.pdf

Furthermore, the seismic data is incorporated as observations in Assisted History Matching (AHM) using ensemble methods, resulting in automated updates of reservoir model parameters based on the spatial information in the seismic data. 

The AHM has been run with time-lapse seismic and pressure (bottom hole pressure) as observations, and with only the pressure data as observations, to measure the effect of adding seismic data as observations in AHM. The results demonstrate that seismic data gives complimentary information about the reservoir behaviour. The reservoir model updates induced by the history matching gives a better match to the seismic observations while also honouring pressure observations.

For this purpose, a carbonate oil field was selected as the case study, and then the corresponding physical properties (e.g., density) and mechanical parameters (e.g., Young’s modulus) were obtained using the laboratory tests. Among the important core data, the Young’s modulus was selected for validating the proposed methodology. Then discrete points of core data together with the well-logging data were input to the artificial neural network (ANN), conventional LFM were calibrated and updated. Then seismic inversion was performed on both the conventional and ANN-based LFM and the results were interpreted in terms of accuracy and reliability. The results showed that the supervised ANN-based LFM had a good compatibility with measured data at a blind well and this reveals the generality and efficiency of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a new pseudo-Helmholtz decomposition operator based on the phase direction of the wavefront. There are three advantages of our proposed wavefield decomposition method: first, by making use of the phase direction, an approximated anisotropic Poisson equation is derived in the space domain. The new Poisson equation gives a more accurate auxiliary field than the Poisson equation in previous methods based on the assumption of kx=kz. Second, there are no mixed high-order derivatives in our proposed method. Therefore, it has a similar computational cost to the zero-order pseudo-Helmholtz decomposition method but has much less computational complexity than the existing first-order pseudo-Helmholtz decomposition operators. Third, we consider the generalized minimum residual (GMRES) algorithm, which is more efficient than LU decomposition, for solving the large sparse linear system after the anisotropic Poisson equation is discretized.",380.pdf

Usually, the NMR transverse relaxation time (T2) decay is interpreted in terms of pore-sizes by the constant known of surface relaxivity (ρs), (Kenyon, 1997; Keating and Knight, 2012). In clean and porous sandstones, the pore radius estimations using NMR can be successfully calculated (e.g. Fleury et al., 2007; Jácomo et al.; 2019), however in heterogeneous rocks with different compositions and magnetic susceptibilities, this relation produces a wide range of relaxivity (Keating and Knight, 2012; Jácomo et al., 2020).

The Barra Velha Formation is the main pre-salt carbonate reservoir in Santos Basin (Southeast Brazil) and is highly studied. However, only some NMR studies investigated these carbonates, and none investigated the relaxivity (Herlinger et al., 2018; Belila et al., 2020; Valle et al., 2021; Castro and Lupinacci, 2022). The objective of this work is to understand which factors can be a source for the range of relaxivity results.

First of all, a new rock physics model was established considering mineral compositions, pore type and fluid content according to the elastic property experiment of shale gas core sample. S wave velocity curve was estimated by the rock physics modelling and the elastic parameters were calculated by P wave velocity, S wave velocity and density. Then, the pre-stack super gather was pre-processed for obtaining high quality angle gather. We derived P wave velocity, S wave velocity and density through pre-stack elastic impedance inversion in framework of Bayes theory under the constraint of prior information such as well logging data, geology knowledge. Finally, under the direction of rock physics analysis, the relationships between TOC content and elastic parameters were established. We find that P wave velocity to S wave velocity ratio had a good relationship with TOC content and we get a high accurate prediction of TOC content. Real data example test showed that TOC content predicted result agreed with geology property and well log interpretation result. The new approach can offer a reliable geophysical evidence for TOC evalutaion.",402.pdf

Individual reflector segments (i.e., ""tiles"") are connected to represent continuous reflector surfaces (i.e., ""patches""). Patches are connected across breaks (e.g., faults) by analyzing all possible jump-correlation paths (i.e., ""displacement vectors"") between patch edges.

Successful acquisition, processing and modelling of S-DAS surveys call for a clear understanding of the GL effect on the data quality. We study the effect of GL using a unique surface seismic field experiment, in which the full optical data were recorded in the field with constant pulse width. Then we realize the data with different GL and trace spacing. We observe that the GL filter introduces notches in the spatial wavenumber domain. We also quantitatively demonstrate that a higher GL does not increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the data. The apparent increase in the S/N is achieved due to spatial filtering. We recommend that the guiding criteria for choosing the GL and trace spacing should be the Nyquist criterion and the data size consideration, but not the S/N issue. Further research can be centered around verifying and analyzing the link between the pulse width and the S/N for surface seismic field data.",417.pdf

Factors that affect the seismic data quality, such as the presence of random noise, coherent noise and imaging with inaccurate velocities were included in the analysis.

Receiver density has been reviewed and optimized, together with source and receiver extent, to ensure adequate provision of offsets beneficial to velocity model building.

In addition, most of the available time lapse data have limited offset characteristics, implying that the deeper part cannot be sampled by diving waves. To tackle these challenges, an integrated hierarchical workflow based on combination of joint diving and reflection waves FWI (JFWI) and simultaneous time lapse strategy is introduced. JFWI mitigates the lack of diving wave penetration, while simultaneous time lapse strategy ensures coupling between baseline and monitor, therefore minimizing the presence of 4D artifacts. As an integrated hierarchical workflow, starting with crude initial model, the combined JFWI and simultaneous time lapse strategy is able to infer relevant 4D macro model.

Tikhonov regularization promotes smoothness of the model and TV regularization is suitable for models with piecewise constant (blocky) structures. Thus, neither of these regularization techniques is able to recover models that contain both smooth and blocky features.

Since hydrocarbon production is what we are ultimately after, we have developed a method to predict the production of wells, including horizontal wells, away from existing well control, when the predictors are available in the vicinity of the wells yet to be drilled.   This paper shows a case study where we use existing production to predict production elsewhere by carefully selecting attributes to put into a Neural Network (NN).   The results show that there are significant areas of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 acreage.  Once you get away from the best of these, and even within them, there are many opportunities to optimize production.",432.pdf

Inversion results are dependent on the input MT response functions. We examine characteristics of the major MT response functions (impedance, apparent resistivity, and tipper) in inversion using their sensitivity patterns. The sensitivity patterns show that xx- and yy-components of the impedance are suitable for 3D inversion; xy- and yx-components of the impedance and apparent resistivity are useful for inversion of 2D structures whose strikes are along the y- and x-axes, respectively; and the tipper can be helpful in imaging both 2D and 3D structures. Through the synthetic examples and case study, we show how to apply the sensitivity patterns for inversion. In the synthetic examples for 2D interpretation of MT data, the features of the sensitivity patterns of the tipper contribute to imaging of a 2D structure for a specific receiver array where receivers right above the 2D structure are not available.

There were three main difficulties: i) Acquisition repeatability: The monitor seismic survey was not initially designed for 4D; its objective was a full azimuth 3D survey for reservoir characterization. Thus, its acquisition geometries were different to the baseline survey; ii) Environment: The water depth of the field is less than 20 m, which generates severe shallow water multiple noises; and iii) Signal strength: The 4D signals were relatively weak due to the nature of the rigid carbonate rock frame. To overcome these challenges, we applied several methods: i) Least-squares migration to minimize the 4D acquisition differences; ii) Iterative cascading demultiple filtering; and iii) 4D signal interpretation with the integration of well production profiles and reservoir dynamic simulation. Ultimately, we identified meaningful 4D signals from 4D inversion that are coherent with our reservoir simulation and well production. In general, water rise from the aquifer was higher than observed in the dynamic model and the model showed heterogeneous water sweep. We also observed an unswept area based on 4D inversion.

To handle practical issues (e.g., DC components, noises), a pre-whitening STC calculation is applied to the time-differentials of original waveform, which in return remarkably enhances the ability in capturing and characterizing coherent wave characteristics.

The first one is what is the difference between reservoirs in lagoon and reef-shoal. Another question is how did the lagoon reservoir form. This paper mainly answers these two questions. Based on  core, cast thin sections, physical property samples, SEM and CT samples, the lagoon reservoir characteristics such as the lithology, physical property, pore type and pore throat size are first analyzed. Secondly, the type of diagenesis is identified and a model of lagoon reservoir formation is established. Finally, an important and special factor is discussed. The result shows that the reservoir in lagoon are mainly packstone and wackstone with high porosity and low permeability. The pore space includes micropore, moldic pore, vuggy pore and visceral foramen. The size of pore throat is usually smaller than 5μm. Different bioclasts lay a foundation for diagenesis. The selective dissolution in marine environment and meteoric environment is the main cause for diverse secondary pores. Furthermore, bioturbation plays an important role in promoting the development of reservoirs in lagoon. Burrows developed by bioturbation could be the flow channel for diagenetic fluid, which could promote selective dissolution.",469.pdf

Based on this, the research on the separation method of blending data(simultaneously excited by the well)—the generalized synchrosqueezed compression curvelet transform and the least squares matching filter is carried out. The generalized curvelet transform eliminates the trailing effect caused by the conventional curvelet transform and provides fine multi-directional and multi-scale decomposition for the input blending seismic data. The synchrosqueezed method is used to accurately redistribute the energy of the anisotropic local wave vector. Takes the least square matched filter as a regular constraint, the generalized synchrosqueezed curvelet transform separates the effective signal from the adjacent shot interference noise with better resolution and higher fidelity. The separation technology also used for real seismic data, the result showed that the technique can separate the blending seismic data and maintain the effective signal without damage.",471.pdf

The conventional deep learning deblending method belongs to the supervised processing approach, it requires synthesizing a large amount of labeled data to train the neural network model, and the availability and diversity of dataset is the key point for deblending. A small size of training samples will lead to overfitting for the model, and the deblending result for real blended seismic data will be poor, and some useful reflection signals remain in the removed blended interference. This study proposes a new self-supervised technical route based on deep convolutional neural network, Mask-Unet Deblending(MUD). By building a deep Unet network architecture and combining with a random masking strategy, it can achieve autonomous suppression of blended interference. Intelligent blended noise suppression can be realized by driving the model to update hyperparameters from the seismic data directly.

For 3D data, there exist different options to organize it into 2D matrices to be able to compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) required for low-rank approximation. It is also essential to find an organization that reveals the rank structure. We examine the different organization options.

Multi-voice acquisition may occur naturally in several cases: when airguns and VibroSeis are used simultaneously in transition zones; or when adjacent marine seismic surveys are shot at the same time with different source characteristics, causing seismic interference.
Another case of interest is the use of individual point sources emitting different bandwidths, as in Distributed Source Arrays. Point sources have several geophysical and environmental advantages compared to source arrays: better accuracy of source position and timing, as well as easier modelling of far field signature.
Deblending multi-voice data is perceived as a risk and therefore an obstacle for multi-voice acquisitions. We present here a workflow to deblend and designature multi-voice data, and we validate it with an application on marine data using a Tune Pulse Source (TPS), which is a low frequency marine source, together with a conventional airgun array.

With a seismic data example from the Outer Vøring basin in the Norwegian sea, we demonstrate how the inversion heals the fault shadow zone, improves the structural imaging compared to the underlying Kirchhoff pre-stack depth and reverse time migration results. The inversion provides a better well to seismic tie compared to the alternatives and the de-coupled parameters (velocity and reflectivity) can be used to directly derive reservoir property attributes such as relative density.

To solve this problem, we propose an improved semi-supervised method that transforms the horizon tracking task into the image segmentation task of stratigraphic sequence between horizons. Firstly, the auto-encoder is used for unsupervised learning of all profiles in the working area, then the parameters of the auto-encoder are migrated to an end-to-end network for supervised learning of labeled profiles. When the training is completed, the model is used to predict profiles. The result of the published data shows that the semi-supervised strategy can improve the horizon-tracking effect in areas far away from the labeled profiles under the same end-to-end model conditions.",485.pdf

Then, the geological data is translated, cell by cell, into petrophysical data (density, Vp, and Vs) using emphirical relationships.

The results show that the Z2dn2 has a generally high content of solid bitumen, ranging from 2.96% to 5.13% on average in single wells.

Various implementations of the Hessian effects have been proposed such as the truncated Newton methods but their implementation in the time domain can be computationally expensive in time and memory. To overcome this bottleneck, we decompose the GN Hessian into a source-side diagonal pseudo-Hessian corresponding to the auto-correlation of the virtual sources and a receiver-side Hessian in the data domain.

The surveys cover a large coherent area on the western flanks of this very large intra-continental basin. Magnetic data images mostly the Neoproterozoic and older sequences. These units contain basalts and dolerites related to the Rodinia breakup. Sub-vertical dykes with mostly northerly trends are common and have been used for mapping and depth to magnetic source analysis. The AGG data generally images thickness and depth variations of clastics versus relatively high-density carbonates. High gravity anomalies generally correspond to combinations of shallow basement blocks, thick and shallow carbonates.

This interpretation has enabled the identification of the pre-Neoproterozoic structure and the thickness distribution of the overlying sequences, including the main reservoir, the Schisto-Calcaire. The improved understanding of the basin development was based on the integration of the subsurface data with the profile-based magnetic depth estimation and 2D gravity and magnetic modelling. The resulting structural maps show unconformities and the distribution of stratigraphic units and were used to map and rank prospects identified in the AGG data.",495.pdf

However, in complex environments such as salt and subsalt, relying on acoustic approximations in FWI limits the accuracy of Earth models derived from modern field data, and may require complex workflows to mitigate the challenges associated with large elastic parameter variations. Recent case studies highlight this issue and suggest that more accurate models can be produced by elastic FWI using simpler workflows in these areas. In addition to elasticity, wave propagation in the subsurface undergoes anelastic (viscous) effects, especially through absorption in gas-charged layers. Although anelastic effects are known to be significant in many visco-acoustic case studies, few examples consider both elastic and anelastic effects in FWI. In this paper, we present a visco-elastic FWI to invert for P-wave velocity and associated viscosity. We demonstrate our approach using ocean-bottom node data from the Central North Sea in a complex area associated with strong velocity contrasts and shallow absorption anomalies.

Seismicity can reveal the location and extent of faults and fractures, and can be used to invert for the state of stress. Both operators and regulators therefore need a clear understanding of the rate of natural seismicity, to identify and distinguish induced events from natural, and to assess the likelihood of induced fault reactivation.

Seismicity predictions are made using probabilistic models, precursors such as average earthquake size distribution. Pore pressure variations cause stress perturbations along pre-existing fault planes in the subsurface, resulting in shear slip and seismicity. Monitoring these stress changes before fault reactivation and its resulting seismicity could greatly improve forecasting seismicity. Stress changes can be determined by changes in acoustic or seismic velocities. Therefore, experiments are performed to detect the preparatory phase of an earthquake using acoustic monitoring. Faulted sandstone samples are reactivated in the laboratory by imposing pore pressure changes by fluid injection under reservoir pressures, while continuously performing passive and active (transmission) acoustics measurements. Using coda wave interferometry (CWI) and decorrelation (K), changes in velocity and scattering are obtained before and during fault reactivation. We show that fault reactivation can be identified by a large velocity drop and an increase in K or by micro-seismic foreshocks. We show that CWI velocity change is most sensitive to both the preparatory phase and the fault reactivation.

In the Seismic Tiles data structure, each reflector segment (i.e., tile, represented by a row) can store information from multiple surveys (each attribute represented as a column), aiding automatic interpretation.
Tailored workflows exploring the data structure also exist. By associating each tile to a horizon, we work with amplitude objects having horizon attributes instead of horizon objects with amplitude attributes. This allows us to query the seismic data to find where specific transmissibility conditions between formations are indicated by the data.

However, the Captain reservoirs contain a relatively heavy oil with moderately high viscosity, which has an unfavourable mobility ratio to water and resulted in early water breakthrough, with oil production at high watercuts and a long production duration at low oil rates. 
In this paper we present recent results from the successful polymerflood Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) development, which have accelerated and increased oil recovery from the field. Polymerflood EOR began in 2011 at Captain with a single successful pilot and additional polymerflood developments have been implemented across larger areas of the reservoirs. These successive developments have continued the success of polymerflood EOR implementation and demonstrate the applicability of this technology across the Captain field. 
Recent results from EOR at Captain are presented, which demonstrate the ability of a polymerflood development to consistently reduce watercuts, increase oil production and maximise overall oil recovery in an offshore location, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of oil production from the field.",519.pdf

With the current momentum in the carbon capture and storage area, new seismic data is often acquired, or old data revisited to assess the potential of candidates, with still limited time for analysis and interpretation. It is very difficult today for geoscientists to precisely quantify the changes in final characteristics of post-stack 3D seismic images. Depending on the person or company doing the processing and the workflow used, the results can be quite different. If this is a challenge for all disciplines, it becomes a particular one for screening CCS candidates and de-risk long term storage opportunities, and especially to analyze cap rock integrity or predict conformance. We will describe a new approach using a genetic algorithm (GA) to automatically extract information from the 3D seismic data in an unbiased manner and in record time and show how this approach can be used to compare seismic images which have undergone different processing.

Flat AVO gradient between angle-stacks observed in the seismic data impacts the usage of AVO tools to discriminate Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHI), therefore thorough assessment of amplitude anomalies identified in the area is an important element in this gas play analysis. Variation of depositional setting and reservoir thickness along the dip direction of these amplitude anomalies brings ambiguity in Direct Hydrocarbon Indicators (DHI) analysis. An adapted SQI (Seismic Quantitative Interpretation) workflow was built to account for reservoir variabilities and impact of tuning in situations of thin reservoir.

Using examples from the Norwegian continental shelf we illustrate a range of machine learning methods, and how these can be integrated into a holistic assessment in Petroleum Systems Analysis. Our aim is not to replace the geoscientist in the analysis and interpretation of the data, but rather demonstrate how we can use machine learning to gain additional insight into complicated data, and how this helps the geoscientist focus on developing a deeper understanding of the petroleum system at hand.",527.pdf

Moreover, in viscoelastic anisotropic media, because the number of moduli and nonzero elements in the matrix grows higher, the computational load is heavier than in viscoacoustic media. To solve this issue, parallel direct solvers (e.g., MUMPS) can be used, but the cost of computer resources is usually too expensive to afford. By contrast, iterative solvers require much fewer computer resources, but they usually have a slow convergence and difficulty in solving multiple sources. Therefore, we demonstrate a parallel iterative solver named P-PCG that enables us to deal with the multiple sources simultaneously but without greatly increasing memory cost. The linear system in our modelling has a dimension of 35.5 million and over 3.9 billion nonzero elements in the matrix. To accomplish this work, MUMPS takes 13.6 hours, 4407 gigabytes and 17 cores, whereas P-PCG only takes 6.3 hours, 64 gigabytes and 5 cores. Another multiple-source modelling shows that on our computer P-PCG can solve 15 sources simultaneously with acceptable speed and much less memory cost than MUMPS.

The liquid build-up reduces the gas relative permeability, resulting in inefficient gas production. In near-wellbore regions, chemical treatments are used to alter rock wettability to stimulate gas-condensate wells and maintain high productivity. In this study, we investigate the effect of the anti-scratch coating (SCC), as a new ethanol-based nanofluid, on production assessment by altering the wettability of sandstone/carbonate rocks from a liquid-wetting to intermediate gas-wetting state. Static contact angle and spontaneous imbibition measurements were carried out to examine the aforementioned phenomenon. Besides, the coreflooding experiments were conducted to analyze the two-phase fluid flow through porous media. All experiments were conducted in presence of the methane gas. According to the results, SCC can significantly reduce the surface free energy of sandstone by reducing the contact angle. For sandstone rocks, spontaneous imbibition experiments showed that imbibed n-decane and brine were reduced by factors of 0.2 and 0.01, respectively. However, these factors were reported as 0.26 (for n-decane) and 0.068 (for brine) for carbonate rocks.

The authors focus on modelling the geomechanical behaviour of the reservoir material, coupled with multi-phase flow solution of CO2 injection into a saline saturated medium. It is proposed to use the SR3 critical state material model which considers a direct link between strength-volume-permeability that evolves during the simulation. Furthermore the material is considered to yield prior to reaching a peak strength in agreement with experimental observations. Multi-phase flow coupled to advanced geomechanics provides a holistic approach to modelling CO2 injection into sandstone reservoirs. The resulting injection pressures, CO2 migration extent and patterns, formation dilation and strength reduction are compared for a range of in-situ porosities and incremental material model enhancements.

In general, an operating company adopts a single approach (Total or Effective) in their modelling workflows and ignores the alternative method. This is normally to have a consistent approach across the company so that the end users know what they are receiving into their subsequent workflows.  

In the proposed method, both Total and Effective Porosity Methods have been applied. The differences are then used to minimise and improve the resulting porosity and saturation calculations such that the results are mutually comparable. Total Porosity based water saturation equations are dependent on the ‘shale/clay’ volume and porosity to compensate for the ‘shale/clay’ bound water resistivity. Effective Porosity is based on water saturation equations on the shale volume and resistivity. The difference is that the Effective Porosity Water Saturation approach is not directly dependent on the ‘shale/clay’ porosity and can be used as a fitting parameter via the dry clay density (that doesn’t exist in-situ) in addition to compensating for the invaded fluid volume.

The exploration success is due to the presence of permeable and porous carbonate reservoirs, salt seals, and multiple traps. The complex geological setting in the Santos Basin generates internal multiples directly interfering with primary reflections within the salt interval and at the deep reservoir level below the salt. In this region, the usual attenuation strategy starts with modelling in the data domain with adaptive matching and subtraction after imaging. While this approach provides improved accuracy in the modelling and attenuation steps, additional computational cost is required to run extra migrations, along with the need of a mature velocity model to accurately bring the input data and internal multiple models into the imaging space. In this case study we adopted an internal multiple attenuation strategy with both prediction and subtraction in the data domain to efficiently produce a dataset with minimal internal multiple contamination prior to pre-stack migration.

At log scale, to honor the seismic response at the base of salt (BOS), we suggest adding the lacking anhydrite layer below the BOS based on geological and drilling information. The proposed strategy appears to be a step change for the wavelet estimation and the inversion products. At field scale, to honor the complex and highly faulted structure, we suggest using a geological grid for prior model building. The combination of this strategy with joint-impedance-porosity process provides not only high quality Ip, but also good porosity magnitude at wells, at superior quality compared with the standard two-step porosity estimation (Inversion followed by porosity estimation).

This method can be combined with conventional methods providing greater model flexibility for reproducing different degrees of connectivity for individual depositional elements. The workflow differs from a conventional modelling workflow by transforming the grid after the facies modelling step: this transformation allows for both facies proportions and connectivity to be honoured. The grid transformation must therefore be considered when defining the modeling inputs and designing the training images.

In optics, the image of a complex object is considered to be a degenerate result obtained by convolving the PSF with the real object. Extracting a row of the Hessian matrix to image is like the spot formed by the PSF, so we can use the PSF deconvolution to compute the inverse of the Hessian matrix. In addition, the Gaussian smoothing X-shaped denoising diffusion filtering operator eliminates noise introduced by PSF deconvolution.

In order to solve the wave equation, which is a Partial-Differential-Equation (PDE), using numerical methods such as Finite Difference (FD), an absorbing layer is defined at the boundaries of the model to avoid unwanted reflections. In wave simulations, a perfectly matched layer (PML) is a highly effective absorbing layer. In many simulations, applying a second-order equation system is simpler and more practical.

The high sensitivity of the elastic properties to porosity and mineralogy as well as the high degree of vertical and lateral heterogeneity in carbonates is often cited as the main reason for this. The absence of a flat spot therefore does not indicate the absence of hydrocarbons. On the other hand, is the presence of a flat spot a DHI?  In some areas of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia, strong flat spots are observed. When drilled these flat spots turn out to be caused by changes in porosity as well as change in fluid. This coincidence may suggest a digenetic effect where porosity is preserved or enhanced by presence of hydrocarbons, especially when containing high levels of carbonic acid (CO2 in solution). Such a scenario was predicted for a recent well, but upon drilling, the flat spot was the base of the carbonate. Rock physics analysis and 2D forward modelling, predicted that a true flat spot might be observed down flank if the reservoir properties were maintained.

This automatic internal QC workflow incorporates an FWI objective function that automatically balances dynamic and kinematic contributions. While the internal QCs are used for automatic control, we show how the attributes generated during the internal QC workflow can be aggregated and reported to provide additional external QCs that can be exposed to the user, providing insight on how the inversion is proceeding and can inform decisions that need to be made.

This allows the fit multiple arrivals in the observed and calculated data. Our extension strategy aims at eliminating the kinematic mismatch at earlier FWI iterations, when the model estimate is poor, and conventional FWI is prone to cycle-skipping. The FWI gradient is computed using the corrected receiver position, giving a correct model update. This is implemented using nested loops optimization strategy, the outer loop solves for the model parameters using a quasi-Newton strategy, while the inner loop solves for the optimal receiver position correction time profiles, using a simulated annealing method.  We constrain the receiver position, and the receiver speed by introducing penalty terms to the FWI problem.

For instance, the post-stack 4D time-shift attribute is usually computed on a partial stack of baseline and monitor, limited to a few wide angles to avoid the high noise content on pre-stack gathers. However, examining pre-stack time-lapse data shows that the recorded time-shifts are offset-dependent and estimating the 4D signature based on the post-stack domain either for the full angle range stack or partial sub-angle stacks could be smeared because the 4D response offset dependency has not been taken into consideration to some degree. Because of the sensitivity of the 4D amplitude differences to the error in the time-shift estimation, pre-stack 4D offset-dependent analysis may be required.
 In this paper, We propose a pre-stack approach for 4D analysis, by correcting the 4D time-shifts in the pre-stack domain and stacking the resultant pre-stack 4D attributes for a representative and cleaner post-stack 4D signature.

Seismic inversion allows the prediction of petro-elastic subsurface properties from seismic reflection data and is an essential component in reservoir modeling and characterization. Traditional seismic inversion methods usually come with a high computational cost or suffer from issues concerning the non-linearity and the strong non-uniqueness of the seismic inversion model. With the generalization of machine learning in geophysics, deep learning methods have been proposed as efficient seismic inversion methods. However, most of them lack a probabilistic approach to deal with the uncertainties inherent to the seismic inversion problems and/or rely on complete and representative training data, which is often scarcely available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a physics-driven deep learning methodology for predicting high-resolution subsurface models from pre-stack seismic data.

The least-squares adaptive subtraction method which finds a matching filter in the time-space domain can commonly be afflicted with primary damage and residual multiples. The curvelet domain adaptive subtraction method usually follows one of two approaches: inversion-based where an objective function is solved iteratively or direct matching of the amplitude and phase of the multiple model and the data curvelet coefficients. The first method requires a separate curvelet transform for each iteration, which is computationally expensive. The second method uses only a single transform but requires careful primary protection.

The method has been successfully applied on a real marine seismic dataset from Picanha project in the offshore Brazil.

Seismic data have accurate information about these geological characteristics, though, it is inadequate to solve the variability in the vertical scale. Geostatistical inversion combines Bayesian inference with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm that allows incorporating all the information from well logs, previous geological knowledge, geostatistical parameters, and seismic data, generating models that honor all the input data. This paper proposes a workflow that integrates the results of geostatistical seismic inversion in a geological grid prepared for numerical simulation without use typical extrapolation algorithms such as Kriging or Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS), minimizing scales differences, obtaining predictive models, with uncertainty estimation. The study area is an onshore oil field in southern Mexico, near to the Gulf of Mexico. The field is located on a regional southwest-northeast structural trend, where there are fields with high accumulated production of light oil from sandstone sequences of Miocene-Pliocene age. The main sequence is Upper Miocene in a transitional environment, which represents good quality reservoir rock and lateral extension, but also high complexity due to internal variability.",615.pdf

If so, only one LF source is required for both velocity model building and imaging purpose, which could significantly simplify acquisition logistics and reduce environmental footprint. During a recent experiment in the Gulf of Mexico, we acquired ocean bottom node data with a special LF source called “Tuned Pulse Source” (TPS) over a 20×0.4 km shot swath. This shot patch was repeated using a conventional airgun array for benchmark. In this paper, we show that migrated images from the new LF source and a conventional airgun array have excellent agreement in the frequency band of 6-45 Hz, even though the new LF source has longer rise time, lower sound pressure level and lower primary-to-bubble ratio compared with conventional airgun arrays. Moreover, ultra-low frequency richness in the LF source data greatly suppresses side-lobe interference in the image and potentially facilitates quantitative interpretation.",617.pdf

Basin modeling is, therefore, necessary to curtail resource-consuming challenges such as dry-hole drilling. However, building accurate basin models to predict secondary migration and dynamics of trap filling is still a formidable problem due to the complexities associated with hydrocarbon movement at large time scales. Despite several commercial basin simulators for modelling secondary migration, they are primarily based on numerical algorithms and require high volumes of data and computation time, adversely affecting effective exploration decision-making. Analytical models, yet, are fast and require moderate data for multivariant analysis of the secondary migration of hydrocarbons while accounting for relevant geological and physical factors. The analytical models proposed in literature for secondary migration offer limited precision when evaluating the combined effects of physical, chemical, and biological reactions.

Scaled laboratory experiments on transparent gelatin blocks by Michael (2021) accumulated significant data on the geometric dimensions of the generated mult-frac growth from both uniformly and non-uniformly-spaced perforation arrays. MultifracSimPPM uses this data to generate profiles which reflect these experimental results, by statistically-biasing random probabilistic distributions. Uniformly-spaced perforation clusters were shown to yield better multi-frac growth homogeneity than non-uniformly-spaced perforation clusters.

Classic hydraulic fracture (HF) treatment design software, although practical, struggle to predict multi-frac growth geometries with sufficient certainty, leading to significant disparities between simulations and field observations. MultifracSimPPM is used to generate realistic scenarios of multi-frac geometries by random sampling considering published empirical data from laboratory tests. Post-stimulation morphology observations from experiments on transparent reservoir analogues can provide more realistic multi-frac geometry data necessary for generating high-fidelity modeling predictions using a robust Monte-Carlo probabilistic scheme.

Conventional filtering methods such as Gauss filtering, median filtering, and F-K domain filtering etc usually blur the useful structural information of seismic data while denoising. Anisotropic filtering can remove random noise and protect structural features in seismic images, so it is widely used in seismic data processing. We propose an improved diffusion coefficient method for anisotropic filtering. The diffusion coefficient of the improved method depends not only on the local energy of the image, but also on the local dip angle of the image. The intensity of diffusion filtering is constrained by the local dip of the structure. When there are faults or large-dip structures in seismic images, the dip constraint makes the filtering coefficient small and the diffusion filtering intensity weak. In the flat region with good continuity or small-dip structures, the filtering coefficient is large and the diffusion filtering intensity is large. Compared with the traditional anisotropic diffusion equation denoising, the proposed method can keep the large-dip structure from being destroyed in the filtering.

The iterative velocity update scheme of DR-TLFWI handles multiples hence it can work with raw seismic data. The tomographic term of the velocity gradient from the reflection energy (low-wavenumber components) is typically much weaker than other components, due to additional reflections taking place during wave propagation. We propose to compensate these additional reflections by the corresponding illumination volume derived in each iteration of the FWI scheme. As such, a dynamic weighting can be devised for the different components in the FWI kernel to optimize the contributions across low- and high-wavenumber components of the velocity model. We use the time-lag objective function to avoid the dominance of strong amplitudes.

It contains the operations between extrapolated source- and receiver-side wavefields in a cross-correlation form. Effective imaging conditions are usually developed to suppress imaging artefacts (e.g. low-wavenumber noise) and enhance the image quality. For acoustic RTM, not only the scalar pressures but also their spatial and/or time derivatives are used in various operations, such as that in the gradient terms of adjoint tomography. These operations implicitly introduce additional angle-domain weighting factors to the image results. In this abstract, based on an analysis of angle-domain properties of the existing imaging conditions, we developed a new imaging condition for RTM. It can be implemented efficiently using the variables in finite difference calculator. Without explicitly measuring wave propagation directions, it can naturally suppress the low-wavenumber noise and keeps a relatively wider imaging aperture (corresponding to a broader wavenumber sampling range). In the angle domain, we conduct a comparative analysis between existing imaging conditions and the new one. Understandings on their angle-domain properties may further benefit to construct more reasonable inversion strategies for full waveform inversion. Numerical examples under various observing geometries also demonstrate the advantages of the new imaging condition.",654.pdf

These pre-processing stages can be complex and time-consuming to implement due to the linear fashion they must be tested and applied. This is especially true in shallow water marine environments where strong short period multiples can obscure the desired target and are non-trivial to attenuate whilst preserving the primary amplitude. Multi-parameter full-waveform inversion (MP-FWI) imaging provides an alternative path by simultaneously determining subsurface parameters, such as velocity and reflectivity, using raw field data as input. MP-FWI imaging is a least-squares method that uses the entire recorded wavefield to deliver a higher-resolution image with improved illumination and amplitude fidelity compared against the conventional approach, which typically involves Kirchhoff preSDM. In this paper, we compare results obtained from a conventional processing and imaging sequence using Kirchhoff preSDM against the results obtained using MP-FWI imaging. We demonstrate that the MP-FWI approach essentially supersedes the conventional workflow in terms of quality of result and project turnaround time on a shallow water marine survey from offshore Sarawak, Malaysia.",657.pdf

To solve this problem, we develop a fast decoupled operator to decompose the P/S waves in 3D vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) media and apply this operator to elastic reverse time migration (ERTM) and associated angle-domain common-image gathers (ADCIGs). To start with, we solve the 3D VTI Christoffel equation and obtain the three eigenvectors that represent P-, SV- and SH-wave polarization directions. We then project the original elastic wavefields to those polarizations and derive the decomposed P/S formulations. To improve the efficiency and model adaptability, we further eliminate the phase angle terms from decomposed formulations and converted the decomposed formulations to the space domain. A fast 3D decoupled operator is thusly developed and produce the approximate P-, SV- and SH-waves components that can calculate the accurate phase angles as those of exact P-, SV- and SH-waves.

The results show The fully water saturation increases the P-wave velocity substantially and reduces the S-wave velocity slightly, which suggest that the P-wave is more sensitive to the water. The rocks containing clay minerals would show shear softening after water-saturated, a possible explanation for reduction of the shear modules is driven by multiple competing factors such as change in stiffness of contacts between clay particles and chemical softening of clay particles.

Seismic data conditioning is normally undertaken within the scope of a conventional reflectivity-based inversion scheme to enhance the primary reflection quality. Primary reflections are often than contaminated with non-primary reflections such as interbed multiples and multiple mode conversions which can interfere negatively with AVO inversion schemes. With the WEB-AVO inversion we can model this non-primary energy and effectively use it to our advantage. This additional information is valuable because it provides stability to the algorithm and adds detail which enhances the resulting inversion products and subsurface understanding. We are hereby investigating with two examples from Onshore China and Offshore NW Shelf Australia how WEB-AVO inversion can provide us with a robust geological model without the need for seismic data conditioning.

In this way, the fluid term can be obtained from the corresponding AVO approximation. However, this assumption limits its application in tight sandstone, of which porosity is low. To avoid the high porosity assumption, we use the C-factor and the corresponding rock physics to simplify the poroelastic theory.

From the preliminary results, we concluded that injecting CO₂ into an oil reservoir appears much more visible on a good, towed streamer as compared to CO₂ injection into a gas reservoir.

To mitigate casing deformation, a good understanding of casing deformation mechanisms is necessary. In this work, a seismic-based analysis on casing deformation mechanism of shale gas wells in the Luzhou block of the Sichuan basin is presented. Based on seismic data, faults and fractures are interpreted, pore pressure and in-situ stresses are estimated, and the casing deformation mechanism is analyzed. The results show that 70% of the casing deformation points are located on faults or fractures with a high stress difference (&gt;15 MPa). The faults/fractures in critical stress state before drilling may be activated by the redistribution of stress after drilling, thereby leading to pre-fracking casing deformation. The faults/fractures in steady stress state before drilling can be activated by the stress perturbation from hydraulic fracturing, thus resulting in casing deformation during hydraulic fracturing. Overall, the main cause of casing deformation in the Luzhou block is fault slip. As seismic data has the potential to provide pre-drill information, seismic-based analyses hold great significance in optimizing drilling and fracturing plans for shale gas wells.",694.pdf

Refraction tomography is a good method to model the shallow subsurface velocity field using the first arrival travel time information of seismic data. The conventional tomography method divides the velocity model into a single size grid, which is difficult to adapt to all shapes of velocity anomalies, and the inversion results are affected by the seismic ray path.

The process can be roughly described as recording the deviation angles of nodes in three mutually perpendicular directions (Pitch, Roll, Azimuth), and then apply this angle to the node data to complete the correction. The traditional correction method uses Euler Angle for data rotation, but this method has its own limitations in the algorithm and there is room for optimization of the operation efficiency. Based on the theoretical analysis of the traditional Euler Angle method, this essay introduces the feasibility of applying the quaternion method to the rotation of multi-component seismic data, and further compares the effects of these two methods in effect, algorithm efficiency and rotation accuracy, and finally summarizes the application prospect of the quaternion method in the future.",731.pdf

Whereas for solving full integral equations high performance computers are needed and these computational costs are expensive, approximations are usually used to solve electromagnetic problems. The scope of this study is to utilize several approximation methods to solve the integral equation for 4D forward modeling of a regular geometrical shape reservoir using CSEM synthetic data. These approximation methods consist of T-matrix approximation (TMA), Extended Born approximation (EBA), and Born approximation (BA).

To resolve the model-dependence, we first expand the depth-dependent terms in the Munk’s formula into a Taylor series with respect to a parameter called the “normalized depth”, and then truncate the series at its first term and linearize the term with respect to the depth. Next, we insert the linearized and the original form of the first term into the Munk’s formula and derive two approximations to the Munk’s formula. By applying the approximate velocity formulas in the corresponding integrals and formulas, respectively, we obtain approximate formulas for both the rays and the traveltimes along the rays, and for the amplitude factors as well.

An integral equation for the particle displacement is, hence, formulated in a matrix-free manner through the application of the Fourier transform. The biconjugate gradient stabilized method is used to iteratively obtain the solution of this equation.

To address this challenge, we propose a new paradigm for FWI regularized by generative diffusion models. Specially, we pre-train a diffusion model on a prior distribution of the expected subsurface models, in a fully unsupervised manner and then adapt it to the seismic observations by incorporating the FWI into the sampling process of the generative diffusion models. What makes diffusion models uniquely appropriate for such an implementation is that the generative process retains the form and dimensions of the velocity model. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method can outperform the conventional FWI with only negligible additional computational cost. Even in cases of very sparse observations or observations with strong noise, the proposed method could still reconstruct a high-quality subsurface model. Thus, we can incorporate our prior expectations of the solutions in an efficient manner. In the presentation of this work, we will share real data applications.",756.pdf

However, its drawback is usually poor generalization when trained with limited training data pairs. Seismic images are dominated by diverse wavelet textures corresponding to seismic facies with various petrophysical parameters, which can be suitably represented by Gabor function. Inspired by this, we propose using learnable Gabor convolutional kernels in the first layer to improve the CNN's generalization for the task of facies classification. The modified CNN combines the good interpretability of Gabor filters and the reliable learning ability of original CNN. More importantly, it replaces the pixel nature of the CNN filters with a constrained function form that depends on 5 parameters that are more in line with seismic signatures. Further, we constrain the wavelength and angle of the Gabor kernels to certain ranges in the training process based on what we expect in seismic images. The experiments on the Netherland F3 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially when applied to testing data with lower signal-to-noise ratios.",758.pdf

In this research, the Decision tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) were sequentially adopted for lithofacies classification and permeability regression applied to data from the Yamama reservoir in a middle-eastern gas field. 
The measured discrete lithofacies distribution was comparatively modeled as a function of well-log data: water saturation, shale volume, total porosity, and effective porosity. The classification accuracy was 92% for both DT and RF. Therefore; the RF-predicted lithofacies were then combined with the well-log data to model the permeability. For accurate modeling and to avoid overfitting, cross-validation of random sub-sampling was performed on the data set to split it into two sub-sets; 70% training subset for modeling and 30% testing subset for prediction.

The image domain LSM (ID-LSM) follows the logic of image deblurring, which realizes the effects of LSM in another way. The key problem of ID-LSM is to calculate a reliable Hessian matrix that can be effectively replaced by a set of point-spread-functions (PSFs). The PSFs calculation depends on forward/migration operator, acquisition geometry, migration velocity, and source signature. Due to the accuracy of these factors and the approximation assumption of PSFs, the calculation result of PSFs cannot be accurate, resulting in artifacts of ID-LSM result. To eliminate the influence of the inaccuracy of PSFs, this paper proposes the ID-LSM problem as a high-dimensional image deconvolution problem.

The most widely adopted approaches often resort to a traveltime-based objective function to mitigate the cycle-skipping problem. Such approaches require a reliable measurement of the traveltime shift between distinct similar events in both the simulated data and the observed data. Limitations on the availability of similar events severely limits the application of those approaches to complex geological environments such as area around salt. In this paper, we proposed a novel enhanced template-matching full-waveform inversion (ETM-FWI) to overcome limitations of conventional traveltime-based objective function.

To overcome this challenge, we evaluated how the incorporation of geological constraints affects the Bayesian facies classification problem. In our approach, we are able to solve the problem of classifying clayey facies in structural highs, classifying only reservoirs when the acoustic impedance values are low in these areas. As a priori information in the Bayesian classification for the igneous facies, we use a probability volume obtained from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) used directly in the seismic amplitude.

The multidimensional deconvolution process, solved using the inversion-based sparsity or low-rank-based optimization framework, as compared to the damped least-square solution, mitigates the ill-conditioned nature of the deconvolution process while maintaining the resolution at all frequencies. However, the underlying requirement for an amplitude-consistent deconvolution using an inversion-based process is to have a denser deconvolution kernel, i.e., a fully sampled downgoing wavefield. While denser source sampling may be preferred, for ocean-bottom surveys, receivers or nodes are often placed on sparse grids. As a result, the inversion-based process becomes unstable at a higher frequency while removing the acquisition-related artifacts during the deconvolution process. In this work, we propose incorporating priors derived from the low-frequency spectrum of Green’s function itself to stabilize the deconvolution process at higher frequencies. Using real data acquired in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, we demonstrate that the proposed prior-driven rank-minimization framework produces an optimal Green’s function across all frequencies while maintaining the computational and memory advantage of the previously established factorization-based rank-minimization approach.",769.pdf

We investigate the input signal's total harmonic distortion (THD) shown as higher-order harmonics at different effective stresses and strain amplitudes from 0.2 to 50 µStrain.

When analyzing wellbore logs, one of the main objectives of the petrophysicist is to derive the formation properties for the region near the wellbore. The environmental and technical challenges faced during wellbore log acquisition and log processing might cause the wellbore logs to be partially or entirely compromised, with part of the measurements not correctly reflecting the formation properties. 
 
Identifying the intervals with one or more logs associated with anomalous data, designated as outliers, and suggesting more likely values for those logs are challenging even for experts.
 
Our work provides a solution to create a robust per-log outlier identification and provide higher-quality data estimated for the zones where the flag was activated using deep learning on multivariate series. The scope of this work includes the basic wellbore logs: gamma-ray, density, neutron porosity, and acoustic slowness, and it provides for the possibility of having one or more corrupted or missing log data. 

In this work, we explicit the advantages over traditional solutions, describe the self-supervised methodology adopted to train the deep learning method and how to define the outliers, and present two applications and field results on test wells.",792.pdf

With this objective in mind, we acquired data near a wind-turbine on-land and analysed the seismic ambient recordings under different wind and wind-turbine operation conditions. Using the continuous ambient recordings, we consequently extracted the impulse response between sensors and measured the dispersive properties of surface waves below 10Hz. The surface wave dispersion observations are in agreement with results from an active seismic experiment using an explosive source in the same area.

The peak pressure in the wellbore exerted by the drilling mud that the wall rock can sustain is given by the so-called Hubbert-Willis (H-W) criterion, which predicts that wall rock failure takes place when the circumferential effective stress at the borehole wall reaches the tensile strength of the rock. However, even though the H-W criterion is a valuable fracture-initiation criterion, it cannot predict if and how an initiated fracture propagates. Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) can provide a solution to these questions. Results from three-dimensional numerical Rigid Body Spring Network (RBSN) lattice modelling are in good agreement with both the H-W initiation criterion and fracture lengths predicted by LEFM. The models can be adapted to situations where more complex fracture geometries are expected, for example due to mechanical layering or wellbores that are not aligned with one principal stress direction.

We present a gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo full-waveform inversion in which the posterior sampling is accelerated by compressing the data and model spaces through the discrete cosine transform, and by also defining a proposal that is a local, Gaussian approximation of the target posterior probability density. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by performing a synthetic inversion test on the initial portion of the BP acoustic model.
The results obtained by the implemented method are also validated against those obtained using a classic deterministic approach.

The procedure involves conditioning the input data to migration, in this case a new approach has been designed to overcome the low coverage limitation by regularizing and interpolating pre-plot locations on the target area. This is achieved by using Matching Pursuit Fourier Interpolation (MPFI) algorithm which reduces migration noise in the target area with irregular or very poor coverage and most important, faithfully constructing subsurface images honoring structures and geologic features.

Post-imaging enhancement processes are normally applied to improve the interpretability of complex structures and in this work a new approach has been designed.

Furthermore, the saline caprock has near perfect trapping characteristics, being very thick and impermeable. 

The geomechanical characteristics of the pre-salt also contribute to the safety of the operation, given that the caprock is in a high-stress state, well over the initial reservoir pressure, resulting in a very effective safety barrier. A thorough geomechanical modelling is critical to evaluate the maximum injection pressures and to assess the caprock integrity risks, particularly in areas of high structural complexity.  In the presence of a thick salt layer, the injection pressures are limited by the overburden stress and the leakage risks are very low in comparison with injection in shallow aquifers.

Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the AVA inversion by building a complicated nonlinear relation between seismic data and elastic parameters based on the training on a large amount of labeled data. However, because of sparse well locations, the application of deep learning based AVA inversion is limited by well-log label sets in production. To mitigate this problem, we present an intelligent AVA inversion method using a convolutional neural network trained by realistic pseudo-well logs. By considering spatial and inter-parameter correlation of elastic parameters, we first generate a large number of realistic pseudo-well logs. Then, angle-domain common image gathers are computed by convolving a source wavelet with angle-dependent reflectivity series, which are used to train a CNN to predict elastic parameters.

Finally, the sub-dictionary is used to perform sparse reconstruction on the seismic data. According to the reconstruction error, it is determined which sub-dictionary the reconstructed seismic signal belongs to. In the process of sparse reconstruction, the amplitude strength of the seismic signal is converted into the coefficient magnitude of the sparse reconstruction. The sparse reconstruction error only reflects the difference in the waveform structure between the reconstructed data and the sub-dictionary, which can alleviate the influence of amplitude strength related to physical property changes, and achieve the purpose of fine identification of geological bodies related to strata structures.

Floating flow enhances the dead-end pore invasion and the flow transformation. We elucidate the effects of pore heterogeneity, injection flux, and oil and brine distribution on storage capacity and efficiency, and interpret them with pore-scale mechanisms. Injection flux affects the preferential and floating flows to tune the velocity of basic storage and determine the profile control or breaking through via inertia induced preferential flow. Pore heterogeneity infers dead-end pore proportion and possibility of breaking through via capillary induced preferential flow.

In efforts to improve seismic image, additional cave features were revealed with targeted seismic reprocessing, which are even much more that those previously observed in conventional seismic. These extensive cave features form the high porosity/permeability side of ccarbonate heterogeneity, which makes carbonate heterogeneity extreme with mixture of various pores and throats in size scales from micrometers at matrix side to kilometers at large void side. The extensive and extreme heterogeneity causes highly even distribution of reservoir characters and high uncertainty in operation efficiency. For tight carbonates, the cave feature are “sweet spots” in drilling, which could lead to high productive wells in exploration. For porous carbonates are “bitter spots” in drilling, which could lead to early water intrusion and low recovery rate from matrix porosity in production.

However, since its excitation band is limited by mechanical properties, it is very challenging to get broadband seismic data using traditional vibrators and vibrator sweep signal design methods [1-3]. Moreover, the large sidelobes of sweep signal autocorrelation wavelets are associated with strong noise, which may degrade the quality of acquired data.According to a literature review, the industry has achieved certain research findings on improving vibrator excitation. For the use of conventional vibrators, nonlinear low-frequency sweep signals have gradually been popularized and employed. However, since the optimal combination of wavelet morphology, low-frequency energy, and bandwidth is not achieved, there is still an opportunity for improvement in data quality. Therefore, using the Riker wavelet, a damped Riker wavelet with very small wavelet side lobes and a broad frequency bandwidth was developed. In addition, the nonlinear sweep signals were designed by combining this wavelet with the low-frequency sweep signal design principle. Comparative data analysis indicated that the sweep signals designed by this method have a better excitation effect.",873.pdf

The polymer projects are currently at different scales, from pilots to full field implementations.

This is due to the low GHG nature of polymer applications due to the water-cut reduction; thus, less produced water will need to be handled at the surface and hence, less power consumption.  However, the majority of the available polymer opportunities/projects are for mature water flooded fields where in many cases, the existing static models will require time consuming updates or rebuilding. Traditionally, complex 3D static models or sector models would be generated for dynamic simulation use. This would cause delays to project delivery and increase the study phase timeline.

To address this issue, we develop a hybrid deconvolution-denoising algorithm based on sparse multichannel blind deconvolution (SMBD). We incorporate the noise in the SMBD formulation and use an alternating minimization method to estimate the multichannel noise and the sparse reflectivity series simultaneously. To promote sparsity, we implement a differentiable and scale-invariant Hoyer regularizer. The algorithm has no constraints on the distribution of noise, which is crucial for suppressing noise from different sources. The by-product of the algorithm is the source signature.

However in the study area, despite the significant burial depth, the Garn Formation includes meter-thick sections of good reservoir properties which stand out against much poorer background sandstones. Understanding extension and continuity of these sections is crucial for production strategy, as they originate preferential corridors for both gas flow and water-breakthrough.
The origin of each of the good quality sections is related to specific diagenetic processes, such as diverse types of grain coating and grain dissolution. Characterization of these diagenetic products, together with the analysis of the associated facies, allows to relate diagenetic and depositional processes and, consequently, modelling reservoir quality for production forecasts and future well placement",904.pdf

However, simulation of steel casings can be complicated because they often have extremely high conductivity and are thin objects arbitrarily oriented. We proposed a fast modeling method that assigns an integrated conductivity property on the mesh edge to simulate arbitrary well trajectory without capturing the pipe's exact geometry using a refined mesh. The edge conductivity approach is implemented using the 3D finite volume method in the frequency domain. This paper verifies its correctness and applicability with field data acquired at an enhanced geothermal system site that involves three steel-cased wells about 4000 m deep. We simulate the borehole-surface survey with one electrode at the bottom of the injection well and the other near the well head on the surface. The simulated data with casings and the measured data both show a consistent data pattern of reduced surface electric field, compared with the simulation without casings. The good agreement between the simulated and observed data shows that the edge conductivity approach can efficiently handle the steel casings for EM reservoir monitoring in practice, and properly modeling steel casings in EM data interpretation is important.",905.pdf

In terms of sedimentary rock types, shale formation is predominantly clay minerals and is one of the most prevalent. Due to their wide availability, advantageous mineralogy, and pore structure, shale formations have become an effective alternative for CO₂ storage. However, because of the high reactivity of carbon dioxide to shales, the mineralogical alteration after CO₂/ brine/shale interaction plays a crucial role in determining the sealing properties of shales at the geological time scale. This study uses an analytical approach to investigate the feasibility of the Bowland shale formation in the United Kingdom for CO₂ storage. The main influential parameters, such as salinity and brine composition, were investigated during carbon dioxide storage. The result showed that the formation of carbonic acid caused the clay mineral (kaolinite and illite) to dissolve in the CO₂-saturated brines, whereas the quartz precipitated.

One of the crucial issues in processing the pressure measurements is transient identification, i.e. dividing the measurement history in sequential transients associated with rate variations. A common approach for transient identification is a continuous trial-test cycle until the end-user achieves the desired results, which is usually a difficult manual process. Automated transient identification is seen as a viable solution to tackle these difficulties and for better control in reservoir operations.

This paper introduces a new method, called TPMR (Topographic Prominence Max Rotation), for automated transient identification focused on shut-in periods. The method uses only pressure data from gauges, while rate data are used only to verify the results. In contrast with common industry practice, the TPMR method identifies shut-in transients without data pre-processing and manual threshold selection, reducing human interaction to a minimum. The paper focuses on testing the TPMR method with real datasets from water injection wells in the North Sea. The testing has demonstrated the capabilities and high accuracy of the TPMR method for automated shut-in transient identification for given datasets.",910.pdf

Ensemble-based history matching methods attempt to address this issue by proposing multi-model workflows that maintain a complete uncertainty description and integrate geologically consistent methods of perturbation. However, the quantitative integration of 4D seismic data in history matching workflows is still a challenge due to its size, resolution, and inherent characteristics. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for the integration of 4D seismic data in an assisted history matching workflow.

The injected gas helps to maintain pressure, which leads to higher gas production rates and recovery factors. EGR also helps to maximize recovery of the gas condensate. If CO2 is injected, EGR could be a precursor to store CO2 storage in the reservoir if the project is transformed to a CCS/CCUS after EGR. If this route is chosen, EGR could have negative GHG emissions as the amount of CO2 stored will be higher than the CO2 emissions from the operations. 
Despite these advantages, EGR is not always economically viable. In some fields the required investments, outweigh the benefits.

Thereby, this research is aimed at more detailed study of the formation based on new approaches to rock typing and oil saturation assessment.

In order to perform core-derived rock typing and characterization we applied alternative FZI, calculated as function of porosity and irreducible water saturation, together with modern techniques for microstructural analyses, such as NMR and CT. That also enabled to explain the formation’s low permeability and low resistivity. For well logs interpretation we proposed technique for permeability calculation as a multivariate parameter. The resulted permeability log matched very well with core-derived permeability.

To implement the proposed model, we first propose to apply the wavelet scattering transform (WST) to seismic data for multi-scale features extraction. Note that the WST has local deformation stability and translation invariance for analyzing seismic data, which would be proven to promote seismic lithology interpretation. Next, the MADL model is suggested to combine the multi-scale features extracted by the WST and seismic data simultaneously, which can improve the accuracy of seismic lithology interpretation.

The depletion can lead to reservoir compaction and to changes in the stress state, affecting both the reservoir and the overburden. These stress changes impact different operational aspects, such as well integrity, sanding potential, fault stability, and well drillability. Understanding the stress state over the lifetime of a field is crucial for safe field development. This study assesses the depletion-induced reservoir compaction and its implications for well design and field development. Laboratory core tests and 3D/4D geomechanical modelling were integrated to predict the reservoir compaction and related stress changes, with significant reservoir compaction and seabed subsidence being calculated at the end of the production schedule. High potential for sanding is expected at the planned wells, leading to requirements for the well completions and to limits for maximum drawdown. The trajectories are designed to avoid regions with higher risk of fault reactivation or casing deformation. Overall, these detailed predictions of stress changes and geomechanical effects due to reservoir depletion have helped to generate a safe and efficient field development plan for Dvalin North",938.pdf

It helps find all the influential parameters and avoid wrongly excluding some important parameters from the 4D SHM process. We apply different localisation approaches such as a sliding window to scan the entire 4D seismic map and dimensionality reduction and feature extraction methods to extract the information content of the 4D seismic maps. The latter transforms the 4D seismic maps into a latent space and represents the maps in lower dimensions. We argue that the dimensions in the latent space are representative of the main signals on the 4D seismic maps. Hence, doing an SA to these features is equivalent to doing it for the main signal in the original space. We couple this scheme with ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) to perform different 4D SHM scenarios based on the conventional and localised SA outcomes. We see that localised SA is superior to conventional SA in terms of its impact on 4D SHM results.

But, the regularization term introduced by the reflectivity inversion method involves the statistical correlation of the three elastic parameters. When the noise is relatively strong, this correlation will cause the inversion results to deviate from the constraints of seismic records and thus affect the resolution. Secondly, the traditional inversion method is usually carried out on a track-by-track basis, and the cross section obtained by the inversion is insufficient in lateral continuity. In view of the above problems, this paper integrates the decorrelation algorithm and the multi-channel inversion method into the inversion of the reflectivity method, and obtains the optimized inversion method. The decorrelation algorithm can effectively improve the resolution of the inversion results by removing the statistical correlation between the three elastic parameters of the initial model. And, multi-track inversion can significantly improve the lateral continuity of the inversion profile. The inversion results of model and real data demonstrate the advantages of the optimized inversion method.",943.pdf

The main goal of this study is to assess the hydrate formation risk during CO₂ storage operations on legacy wells of a highly depleted gas field. To assess if a well is subject to hydrate risk, dynamic pressure and temperature profiles in the formation are analysed using hydrate phase diagrams (P-T paths technique). The hydrate formation condition is flagged if the P-T paths enter the hydrate stability zone at the place where water is present. The method application is presented for a gas producer well and a water dump disposal well.

However, due to the small fault throw of the strike-slip fault and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the seismic data, it is difficult to identify strike-slip fault accurately. Moreover, the fault-controlled karst-fracture-cavity reservoir is extremely heterogeneous in space.

The cause lies in reservoir compaction driven by pressure depletion. Compaction in sandstones often includes elastic and inelastic components. The inelastic part is partly due to rate- or time-dependent processes. However, few mechanism-based rate/time-dependent compaction laws exist, despite the need to evaluate the impact of prolonged reservoir exploitation and post-abandonment behavior. Therefore, we investigated the effect of loading strain rate (strain rates of 10-⁶ to 10-⁸ s-¹) in uniaxial strain and triaxial stress experiments performed on water-saturated Slochteren sandstone. Our results showed a lowering of stress-strain curve levels with decreasing strain rate in the triaxial experiments. In contrast, the lowering in the uniaxial experiments was negligible. The observed rate effect is likely caused by intergranular clay shearing/compaction, although stress corrosion cracking cannot be entirely ruled out. Our results show that time-dependent inelastic deformation plays an important role in controlling reservoir deformation and associated change in stress during fluid production from sandstone reservoirs. This needs to be accounted for when assessing surface subsidence and induced seismicity. The present results thus provide important input for testing models for rate/time-dependent reservoir compaction.",957.pdf

Subsequently, the hydrocarbon expulsion behavior is analized with the occurrence state of solid bitumen in pores at different stages. Image-based porosity revealed a trend of a significant decrease in porosity from 8.9 vol% at 0.8 %Ro to 0.7, 1.4, and 2.5 vol% at 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 %Ro, respectively, suggesting clear pore occlusion in clay matrix. A sharp increase in porosity to 13.6 vol% at 1.3 %Ro indicates that the primary phase of hydrocarbon expulsion occurs between 1.2 and 1.3 %Ro, which is slightly delayed compared to the results of previous research based on geological evolution samples. At the onset of the dry gas window (1.5 %Ro), the porosity of the pyrolyzed sample decreases to 7.2 vol%, which may be caused by the inherent variability of the hydrous pyrolysis experiment, or additional occlusion of pores resulting from ongoing hydrocarbon cracking processes. In summary, the results of this study have significant implications for shale oil extraction behavior, but also for the matrix permeability evolution of organic-rich seal rocks.",964.pdf

A situation such as this, usually occurs during subsurface oil field procedures. Solids invasion, fines movement, organic deposition, and collapse and swelling formations (clay formations) generally cause this undesirable and complicated situation. As a result of formation or skin damage, fluids cannot flow into the wellbore and low permeability reduces the well's productivity. Economic losses resulting from formation damage are directly reflected in production losses. If a Well is damaged beyond repair, it may become economically unviable and may be shut down. For the oil and gas industry, finding ways to solve this problem and preventing formation damage are the most important efforts. This article initially focuses on formation damage and its occurrence mechanisms, the most important damages of the formation are examined in the following sections, and each damage is evaluated separately to determine its severity. One of the important issues that needs to be addressed is how to show the amount of formation damage.

The main reasons are that the quality of deep seismic data is poor, the facies zone changes rapidly, and the quantitative prediction of thin interbeds is difficult.

Compared with the hard partition algorithm of k-means clustering, this method can effectively eliminate singular values, accurately identify geological bodies with different shapes and dimensions, and well describe the uncertainty of sample points. Secondly, in view of the small difference in wave impedance of sandstone and mudstone in local target interval, through petrophysical analysis, the reservoir sensitive parameters are established, and the distribution characteristics of target thin interbed are carefully described, so as to make the reservoir research from quantitative to semi-quantitative.",981.pdf

The possible presence of gas, competing with oil for pore space and seal capacity, complicates exploration decisions in many aspects.

First, the definition of success is often tied to the presence of hydrocarbons, which also includes gas. This makes the estimation of the chance of success (COS, or “risk”) easier, even though gas might be considered as failure.

Also, the composition of success-case volumes (“resources”) might contain considerable amounts of gas, which does not favor oil. Oil versus gas column height uncertainty is performed in a rather arbitrary way.

Finally, the decision of where to place a first exploration well can also be difficult for a dual phase accumulation. 

In the presented paper, we address those issues with a new workflow using Ariane Exploration and Appraisal Asset Evaluation (EAAE). This new tool addresses the confusion of well versus prospect COS and the volumes which can be proven by one well, based on a consistent assessment of oil versus gas occurrence (risk) and column heights (resources).",988.pdf

This work compares the lab-measured m exponent with the m exponent calculated using empirical models. The samples are carbonates rocks from Barra Velha Formation, Brazilian pre-salt.

The carbonate rocks are heterogeneous and have a variety of porosities types that modifies easier. Although the Rafiee model shows the nearest predictions regarding lab-measured estimates, it still exhibits large discrepancies.

Fortunately, the distance of those 9 fields is not too far away from each other. In addition, the field location benefits the project as it is in the middle of an integrated-gas facility in South Sumatra. Hence, integrating all the projects is found to be the best way on developing the fields to obtain the cost-competitiveness of delivering gas to consumers and fulfilling gas specification requirements.

The Coquinas are analogous to pre salt reservoir from Campos and Santos Basins.  There is still no public result regarding the pore compressibility of Itapema and Coqueiros Formation, from Santos and Campos Basins respectively. For this reason, this work aims to estimate the pore compressibility of Coquinas Carbonates simulating natural reservoir conditions. The results endorse optimistic conclusions, showing that most coquinas' pore compressibility behaviour from Morro do Chaves are similar to sandstone trend, once porosity tends to reduce along with increase of compressibility. Furthermore, four models were applied to estimate and rate the best prediction for the pore compressibility calculation method. The Oliveira model presented better results for most of the pressure intervals. Despite it, none of those models deals with pore geometry, which can impact the pore compressibility of some samples and may explain the deviation from the model's predictions.",1001.pdf

A linear trend can be appropriately fitted to the estimated δ and ε to form depth-dependent trends, however the goodness-of-fit for the δ trend is noticeably poorer. Anisotropic and isotropic models for reflectivity variation with angle have been calculated for each group using elastic depth trend information and estimated δ and ε. Modelling shows that the anisotropic reflectivities begin to deviate from isotropic values as early as 20° and the difference increases significantly thereafter. This suggests that far angle stack bright events might be enhanced by the presence of anisotropic shales, therefore caution should be taken when interpreting these bright anomalies in terms of fluid presence and fluid type.",1003.pdf

The pressure buildup caused by CO2 injection may lead to serious safety issues, caprock damage, induced seismicity, and leakage. One of the practical solutions for mitigating reservoir pressure buildup is brine extraction. Still, the location of the brine extraction well should be optimized because the performance is affected by the well placement in heterogeneous reservoirs. 
The optimization of brine extraction well placement is computationally expensive because many simulation runs are required. Robust optimization using multiple reservoir models requires much higher computational costs.
Therefore, we propose a machine-learning-based surrogate model that quickly predicts the optimality of brine extraction well. The surrogate model uses a fast-marching method to calculate time-of-flight values that can represent hydraulic connectivity. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) predicts the net present value (NPV) by considering the spatial connectivity of a TOF map. When applied to an actual field model, our surrogate model predicted the NPV very well, achieving the averaged determination coefficient value of 0.84. Also, using only 10% of the total location candidates, our surrogate model significantly reduced computational costs.",1007.pdf

The conventional prestack depth migration method is based on the ground observation system. The output gather is offset gather, which lacks valuable azimuth information. The OVT domain processing method can output the gather with azimuth information, but the gather is also offset gather. The underground local angle domain omnidirectional migration method directly starts from the real reflection point, and uses the ray scanning tracking method to construct the formation dip angle and ray pair information of the underground reflection point. The underground local Angle domain omnidirectional migration method can provide reflection data, dip data, mirror weighted data and scattering weighted data for pre-stack and post-stack fracture prediction. The prediction effect is more stable and the prediction results are more reliable.
In this paper, Q prestack depth migration in an all-directional Angle domain is carried out on the basis of wide-azimuth seismic data.

Our contribution to underground hydrogen storage is related to the modeling of multiphase flow in porous media. In the present work, we focus on the processes of capillary trapping and spatial heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties of the porous medium. To evaluate the spreading of the saturation front due to spatial heterogeneities, we model the immiscible displacement of brine by hydrogen. We simulate multiple cycles of H2 injection/production in a test volume, incorporating hysteresis in the relative permeability to study how this condition impacts hydrogen dissolution, purity, and recoverability. We compare cases with and without hysteresis to investigate the role of viscous forces and heterogeneities alone. These cycles also help us understand the balance between fingering stability and gravity override.

The virtual source method is a fundamental step in most of the existing redatuming techniques when a source that can regenerate the existing data is estimated in the least squares sense. 
The standard time-reversal (TR) estimates the virtual sources as the adjoint solution of a source estimation at the expense of the least-squares solution to mitigate computational cost. However, this limits the applicability of the method to the cases when an accurate macromodel exists and the acquisition fully illuminates the subsurface. In this research, we solve the virtual source estimation problem in a least-squares sense with a simple zero-order Tikhonov regularization to mitigate the computational cost. Our proposed method relies on a change of variable when the wavefields are reconstructed in the frequency domain instead of the virtual source. Then, the redatumed data are simply obtained by sampling these wavefields at the receiver datum.

Despite the very broadband frequency response of dynamite shots, Vibroseis source provided much cleaner records. We recorded good quality data that enabled imaging reflectivity correlating with the faults/fractures and lithology changes intersected by the drillhole even below the maximum cable depth.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a potential technique for shale evaluation. However, NMR measurements remain challenging for shale motility evaluation due to the lack of understanding of the movable oil relaxation mechanism. There is still controversy for the NMR relaxation mechanisms of fluids in shale organic pores. In this paper, we analysed the spectral density function of the existing NMR relaxation theory and determine the correlation time threshold that can produce frequency dependence. This threshold is helpful to investigate the relaxation mechanism of movable oil. We then determined the T1/T2 values corresponding to the movable oil peaks by performing T1-T2 measurements on two samples. The experimental results show a strong frequency dependence for the T1/T2 values of the movable oil. Finally, we simulated the theoretical T1/T2 curves of the movable oil under different relaxation mechanisms and compared them with the experimental results. The experimental and theoretical results show that the interaction between H nuclei and paramagnetic ions is more suitable to characterize the relaxation phenomenon of movable oil in shale compared to the H-H-dipole-dipole interaction.",1045.pdf

Core, geophysical and image logs, are compared to document the characteristics of natural fractures distribution, and investigate the geological parameters influencing their development. The main control on the distribution is identified. Natural fractures are concentrated in heterolithic lithological intervals of the VAL-01 and NLW-GT-01 wells. The identification of more fractures in VAL-01 compared to NLW-GT-01 can be explained by the difference in basin location. VAL-01 was located in the centre of the basin where distal playa environments produced fine-grained material alternating with coarser sands. The more proximal NLW-GT-01 was dominated by fluvial sands. The lithological variability produces Young’s modulus variability that seems to be driving increased fracture density rather than that the absolute value of the Young’s modulus. These fluctuations could be the result of concentrated compressional stress, which is supported by the existence of stylolites, indicative of high compressional stresses in the same intervals. The identification of controls on fracture distribution in the targeted stratigraphic interval can be used to optimize the planning of future geothermal doublets and to de-risk upcoming operations.",1051.pdf

The FNO model is trained using first arrival traveltimes on observation locations used as the input to predict the traveltime field in the entire computational domain.

In particular, the sparse FPCA method is used, which can extract the underlying random process from an ensemble of sparse production timeseries to predict the smooth trend of the well production data. The production from wells with short histories is also extrapolated using the stochastic information extracted from the wells with longer production. This approach is applied to analyze production data from 500 wells in an unconventional tight oil reservoir. In addition, the multivariate FPCA is utilized herein, for the first time, to jointly project the simulated surface condensate and gas rates from an unconventional gas condensate model by accounting for the correlations between the production phases.

We evaluated the impact of attention on machine-learning-based processing of seismic data by comparing results obtained without attention, with single attention, and dual attention.

Although work has been done to estimate squirt flow the characteristic frequency associated with squirt flow effects, there is a gap in the literature on how this characteristic frequency varies with saturation. In this work we describe how relative permeability affects the squirt flow characteristic frequency for rocks saturated by two fluids. We show that the effective permeability observed under partial saturation lowers the characteristic squirt flow frequency, leading to attenuation in lower frequencies. We also describe how this phenomenon can explain a puzzling stiffening of rock due to dispersion, despite the softening of its fluid content.

Results show that porosity ranges from 2 to 18.5 and permeability from 0.001 to 285 mD. Dolomite represents the most abundant cement and show an inverse correlation with porosity. Illite occurs in higher concentrations in samples with values of permeability below 20 mD, while kaolinite becomes the most dominant phyllosilicate cement in samples with higher permeability. By looking at the main cement distribution over the sedimentary facies, it appears that dolomite is strongly related to depositional facies and has a positive correlation with grain size, while illite and kaolinite yield a negative correlation with grain size.

For pulse injection scheme, none of the studied solutions conserve mass at high dispersion. Nevertheless, one of the solutions has a tolerable deviation from mass conservation and is recommended for use in short laboratory columns with high dispersion.

Another conclusion is that using pulse injection scheme and the analytic solution for Robin/Semi-infinite boundary conditions is the most optimal way to work with short laboratory columns, such as core plugs, because such solution correctly accounts for the dispersion at the boundaries and has only negligible mass conservation issues at low Peclet numbers in comparison to other analytic solutions.",1096.pdf

UAV surveys can safely and cost-effectively be conducted with a dense line spacing while tightly draping the topography, significantly improving the data resolution. 

For UAV magnetic surveying, the sensors are often placed in a gradiometer system towed underneath the UAV and far away from any onboard electronics to minimise the magnetic noise. In gradiometry surveys, even the sensor-specifics can result in line-to-line striping. In addition, imperfect draping and orientational deviations from the set survey heading will also result in line-to-line striping.

This study discusses the processing of a multi-sensor UAV-towed magnetic survey. The raw total-field data and the across-, along-, and vertical-track differences (gradients) show significant line-to-line striping. The proposed processing method relies on modelling the along-track differences using an equivalent sources model to remove the noise responses from both sensor-specific noise and noise responses from attitude/attitude deviations. After the processing, the modelled differences show significantly less line-to-line striping.

Numerical modeling and simulation can overcome the limitations associated with analytical solutions and deal with more realistic situations, such as the case of multizone hydraulic fracturing (MHF), where multiple and simultaneous fractures propagate in the reservoir. This work aims to investigate the MHF by using the Mesh Fragmentation Technique, in which high aspect ratio interface elements with suitable constitutive laws are employed to model the hydro-fracking process. The HAR-IEs are inserted between the regular elements of the finite element mesh during the pre-process. This methodology does not require the creation of new elements or a tracking algorithm to capture the fracture pattern. The fracture formation and propagation can occur freely in the domain depending only on the material properties and stress state. The application case proposed in this work investigated the simultaneous evolution of three fractures. The results showed that (i) the MFT can properly model the formation and propagation of multiple hydro-fractures and (ii) the distance between the perforations plays an important role in multizone hydraulic fracturing.",1111.pdf

In our analysis we investigated three types of causal factors, hydraulic stimulation, shallow and deep produced water injection. However, our approach can be used also into Geothermal and CCUS projects. 

The proposed workflow can be used to identify causal linkage between different geo-energy related subsurface operations and seismicity. Two out of the four different approaches have predictive capabilities. The application and accuracy of the proposed approaches is highly based on the availability of information. Although, this workflow has been applied successfully in different areas (e.g., Oklahoma, Texas) we believe that accurate hypocentral depth estimation is an additional parameter that can validate any statistical, physics-based, or geomechanical model assessment of causal linkage of seismicity with O&G operations and should be included in induced seismicity assessment.",1112.pdf

though calibration would allow measuring the absolute water height at any location. Because we used
two poles with different exposure lengths to air, at different depths and only 38 m apart, we can interpret he spectral oscillations are a result of constructive interference in our poles, likely generated by the
wind. DAS could be a very attractive alternative for tidal monitoring in shallow marine environments,
ports and waterways. DAS could potentially resolve spatial resolution problems with tidal monitoring,
which is currently cost-prohibited, at a relatively low expense by wrapping a fibre around a pre-existing

Current geomodelling workflows, however, are too time consuming to build and explore different contrasting geological scenarios at various scales.
In this study we used the open-source Rapid Reservoir Modelling (RRM) software to design different geological scenarios of a shallow marine succession hosting a potential geothermal reservoir and analyse how multi-scale geological features impact reservoir flow.  RRM allows users to quickly create and explore realistic 3D geological models from intuitive 2D sketches. Models arecreated in minutes while flow diagnostics allow us to analyse fluid-flow behavior in real-time.

The uncertainties associated with this EOR method are greater when dealing with a real crude oil and a highly reactive rock material. Chalk reservoirs are particularly challenging because of their low matrix permeability, high porosity, high degree of heterogeneity, and high tendency for surface reactions. In the literature, experiments on outcrop chalk cores have been extensively reported, however, there is still a lack of data for reservoir chalk material, and further, there are no results on preserved core materials showing how differently they might behave compared to dry-stored reservoir plugs. There is thus a question of how the wetting condition of the reservoir is represented by these types of samples.

Although many land surveys attempt to perform regular acquisition and produce uniform OVT fold, there is much irregularity imposed on many land surveys.  Instead, we propose to embrace the irregularity as an opportunity.  We propose to use acquisition irregularity to optimize signal quality and costs by treating the source and receiver placements as a computer optimization problem.

This contribution looks at different processing steps to, on the one hand see the resource gain from automated tools such as first break and velocity picking algorithms and on the other hand resource intensive methods such as prestack time migration which provide a huge increase in imaging quality.

In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have proven to be a powerful tool for data analysis. However, their performance strongly depends on the training data and labels, whose generation is often a highly time-consuming task. In this study, we propose to generate synthetic seismic data that contain reflections, diffractions and noise and the corresponding labels consisting of only reflections and diffractions, respectively, in an entirely automatized fashion. We complement this data by reference results from field data applications of coherent wavefield subtraction, a deterministic method that extracts the reflected and diffracted wavefields from the input data. With the combined dataset we train a convolutional autoencoder and apply the trained network to seismic and GPR field data.

These reservoirs are composed of chalk, which is a low permeable rock but with high storage capacity. As ultimate oil recovery by natural depletion is low and water based EOR methods are less practical due to low injectivity of the reservoir rock, gas injection is a proper scenario thanks to low viscosity and good miscibility effects of gas. Availability of gas, feasibility of operation and environmental issues limit options for injection. Therefore, a comparison between final recovery obtained by different gases can help us to a better selection, environmentally and economically. Produced gas is always a candidate because of availability at place and compatibility with reservoir content. Flue or exhaust gas and pure CO2 are other candidates that can also contribute to carbon sequestration and reduce CO2 emission.

Thus, it is impossible to image and classify the subsurface features with these local heterogeneities.  Still, the angle-dependent response  encodes heterogeneity information that assists overcoming this issue if used properly.  To exploit its capabilities, we present a way for identifying reservoir characteristics in the presence of local heterogeneity by linking encoded angle-dependent responses created using angle-dependent Full Wavefield Migration with their originating source - the relevant geological context. To accomplish this purpose, a pipeline technique that integrates the produced angle-dependent responses with a pattern categorization deep-learning tool is proposed.

A common seismic attribute used for assessing reservoir evolution during production is the time-shift measurement which is obtained comparing two 3D seismic images. In the case of superimposed reservoirs, computing these time-shifts becomes challenging due to the change at the top reservoir that affects measurements at the lower one. Directly computing the wave propagation velocity variation between the time-lapse seismic data is an alternative solution. These obtained velocities need to reach a sufficiently high frequency to ensure a vertical resolution to correctly separate the reservoirs.
On two offshore West-African case-studies, we illustrate how 4D FWI workflow can finely separate superimposed reservoirs, by providing high resolution velocity variations along the monitoring time. The first case study consists of short offset towed streamer acquisition where the challenge of missing low frequency and diving wave penetration is undertaken by a combination of 4D tomography and 4D FWI. For the second case study, long offset node records mean that only the 4D FWI is needed.

 An artificial Intelligence based on genetic algorithm (GA) has been used successfully to automatically compute an extensive horizons/faults/attributes database.
After a processing step which lasted less than 12 minutes for each seismic volume, maps with various attributes were displayed for all the layers computed by the AI including amplitude for instance. 
Main faults planes and subtle features were also extracted and integrated into a database with their own properties and fault throw maps.
The genetic algorithm automatically generated a suites of e waveform, attributes and other characterization of surfaces and faults that help build stratigraphic /structural domain and seismic facies maps within the entire potential area top to bottom in less than a day.
Such an automatic, extremely fast, and unbiased approach can help the geoscientists directly focus their time and attention visualizing and interpreting the significance of the results delivered by the artificial intelligence for various applications.

Radon-based algorithms are often used for multiples and primaries discrimination. Deep learning, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown encouraging applications for demultiple that could mitigate Radon-based challenges. In this work, we investigate new strategies to train a CNN for multiples removal based on different loss functions. We propose combined primaries and multiples labels in the loss for training a CNN to predict primaries, multiples, or both simultaneously. Moreover, we investigate two distinctive training methods for all the strategies: UNet based on minimum absolute error (L1) training, and adversarial training (GAN-UNet).  We test the trained models with the different strategies and methods on 400 synthetic data. We found that training to predict multiples, including the primaries labels as a constraint, is the most effective strategy for demultiple. Finally, we test the methods on a field dataset. UNet models trained with L1 report competitive results with Radon demultiple on field data, and better performance than GAN-UNet on synthetic and field data. As a result, it can potentially replace Radon-based demultiple in existing workflows.",1170.pdf

They form sub-vertical and sub-horizontal networks of permeable sandstone reservoirs, which often contain commercial hydrocarbons. In the subsurface, defining the geometry and distribution of sandstone intrusions and their reservoir quality is challenging, and constitutes a high level of uncertainty in subsurface models. The Tumey Giant Injection Complex (TGIC) is a well-exposed, excellent analogue for subsurface injection complexes. Herein, outcrop of a km-scale wing intrusion is used to create a 2D geological template as the basis for static and seismic reservoir models. The 2D and 3D static models combined outcrop geometries, injectite facies, and rock properties data to demonstrate spatial relationship between injectite facies and to derive pore volume and their distribution. Seismic modelling used the geological template and petrophysical well data as input for 2D point-spread function (PSF) based seismic modelling to create 2D synthetic seismic data. Results show that seismic data fail to image substantial “sub-seismic” reserve volumes, and that the reservoir geometry is oversimplified.

Furthermore, the observed reduction in reservoir properties (porosity and permeability) compared to the close by exploration well came rather unexpected.  

By comparing near to far offset stacks, a near offset amplitude anomaly is observed around the producer, quite consistent with the gas water contact, however fading out towards the producer area. Further investigations of the two outputs of a GRT migration, namely a S/N enhanced and a diffraction enhanced image, however, shows a local disturbance in line with previous findings. This is also supported by petrography analysis which attributes the reduction in macro porosity to local disturbances in grain orientations and packing.

The high-resolution gravity data has particularly well characterized the structural scheme. A total of 10 shallow boreholes have been realized (100m deep) in order to calibrate the stratigraphy in areas with high uncertainty but also to test the possible presence of gas in structures prone for gas accumulation. 2 wells were particularly successful and were completed after exhibiting strong gas influx while drilling. The implementation of a pilot production facility is underway. Such unit will separate and purify helium in one side and food grade CO2 in the other side.

Heritage seismic in the area often suffers from distortion and poor focusing of pre-salt targets, resulting in interpretation uncertainty. 

In this case study, we demonstrate how the application of contemporary data-processing and imaging workflows to heritage data from the area can significantly improve the reliability of pre-salt interpretation. Key to these improvements are the latest developments in full-waveform inversion which include multidimensional objective functions and automated decision making.

However, the industry has struggled to bridge the gap between R&D and scalable daily use for internally developed machine learning capabilities. 

In this talk, we discuss the challenges Aker BP has had in robustly translating the products of its internal ML innovation into daily use. We will present a pragmatic approach to Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) that was adapted in the Automatic Well Interpretation group. It has allowed us to greatly accelerate the adaptation and value creation from internal innovation in ML. Using a combination of open-source tools, serverless infrastructure and secure APIs, we can develop, deploy and continuously improve machine learning models for automatic well interpretation while they are being leveraged every day to deliver on the core tasks in exploration and reservoir development. This has allowed for internally developed machine learning models to be included into standard subsurface workflows, where robustness, predictability and reproducibility is key.",1228.pdf

Although many solutions, workflows and technologies exist for characterizing the subsurface and modelling the effects of injected fluids, these are generally governed by the temporal and spatial scales of oil and gas exploration and production.

This has generated the need for modelling solutions that allow for screening, and understanding capacity, injectivity and containment of injected CO2 over multiple temporal and spatial scales.

This reflects to a large extent the increasing exploration maturity of outcropping and near-surface environments in established metallogenic provinces and districts. Minerals exploration is becoming increasingly technically challenging and more expensive. More effective exploration targeting across a range of scales is therefore essential to increase success rates and potentially reverse or slow the trend of increased discovery costs.
Understanding the mineral system more holistically enables us to de-risk exploration investment decisions and to better predict the economic potential of an area under exploration. Only when we consider and quantify all system-critical processes over geological time, that a robust validation of a mineral system is possible and allows us to test various system hypotheses. The resulting mineral system models then allow us to define the key risk factors for an effective resource assessment.

In this paper we present an approach of prestack depth migration by the Gaussian beam summation (GBS) method in anisotropic media.

Understanding the mechanisms of crack initiation can help engineers predict when and where rock failure is likely to occur, which can inform decisions about design and safety. Crack initiation in rocks can be studied using image processing techniques. Image processing involves the analysis and manipulation of digital images to extract meaningful information. This can be done through techniques such as digital image correlation (DIC), which allows for the measurement of displacement and strain fields in rocks under different loading conditions. Therefore, this paper presents a study aimed at predicting tensile crack initiation in rock samples using DIC. The study used rock specimens of Marble and Travertine and performed direct tensile strength tests to determine their strength characteristics. To do that, the DIC technique was employed to measure the rock surface displacement field under direct tensile stress.  Afterwards,  the divergence of this field was calculated to identify the location of crack initiation. The results showed that the regions with the maximum positive divergence value reflect the pure relative expansion of the surface, thereby helping in identifying the location of crack initiation.",1258.pdf

This study presents an interdisciplinary approach consisting of geology, geomechanics, gas technology, geodesy, and geophysics in order to provide a process understanding how subsurface and surface are geomechanically coupled in the eastern Ruhr hard coal mining area, western Germany.

However, in actual seismic exploration, the point source excitation method is often used to generate spherical waves rather than plane waves, which is an enormous gap from the plane waves used in conventional AVO research. Especially at the near-critical angles and the over-critical angles, the difference of AVO response between spherical waves and plane waves is particularly obvious. Meanwhile, conventional seismic exploration mostly assumes that the stratum is isotropic, but actually the layer is anisotropic, the elastic parameters of the media will change with the direction. In this abstract, we derive analytical expressions for the spherical wave reflection coefficient (SRC) in VTI media based on the plane wave reflection coefficient (PRC), meanwhile, investigates the SRC within Fresnel zone in VTI media.

Pore network models (PNMs) are indirect PSMs which are practiced considerably due to the lower complexity and the larger size of media that they cover. In this study, a dynamic PNM of imbibition for waterflooding is developed where both viscous and capillary forces are considered as well as two main fluid displacement mechanisms–frontal displacement and wetting layer flow. Displacement profiles are obtained under three different capillary numbers and by assigning four different contact angles. Effect of viscous and capillary forces are considered alongside to investigate the trend of different properties–backflow and snap-off.

Additionally, existing lithofacies identification models are deterministic and lack a mechanism to evaluate the reliability of their results. We propose a lithofacies identification method based on the Query by Committee (QBC) strategy and Gaussian mixture Naive Bayes (GMNB) to address these limitations. Our method contributes to the field in three key ways: (i) The QBC strategy selects the most valuable unlabeled samples for labelling, enabling effective expansion of the training set.

Using numerical modeling, we compare the early post-injection evolution of the CO2 plume in a synthetic dipping aquifer under different directions of groundwater flow. We measure the size of the plume, its mobile portion as well as the instantaneous velocity at its leading tip. 
The study shows the direction of groundwater flow can affect the extent and evolution of the CO2 plume during and post injection. When the groundwater flows downdip, opposite to the direction of CO2 plume, the plume stretches further during its upward migration compared to the updip groundwater flow scenario. This increases the extent of the mobile CO2 and causes the plume to accelerate during updip migration due to the greater acting buoyancy forces. 
In contrast, when groundwater flows updip, in the same direction as the plume migration, the plume decelerates due to the combined effects of greater residual and dissolution trapping, which decrease the size of the mobile CO2, and reduced buoyancy due to the smaller size of the mobile plume. Hence, an updip groundwater flow can better reduce the risk of CO2 leakage during its early migration.",1439.pdf

Due to their very nature, the quantification of fugitive methane emissions is non-trivial and existing frameworks e.g. based on equipment-specific, sometime-calibrated, emission ‘factors’ are not necessarily representative for Australian conditions. To overcome these issues and to improve fugitive emissions monitoring, estimation and subsequent reporting, top-down approaches are becoming increasingly popular.

Conventional NMO correction is generally based on velocity parameters, but velocity analysis is generally time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the relevant velocity parameters picked up are often inaccurate, resulting in poor NMO correction effect. At the same time, conventional NMO correction also has the problem of stretching distortion. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new multi-scale dynamic time warping (MS-DTW) algorithm for velocity-independent stretch free NMO correction, which has higher accuracy and stronger noise resistance. Firstly, multi-scale morphology is applied to decompose the original seismic data into multiple morphological scales, and the alignment error is calculated and weighted at each scale, so that a more robust alignment error result can be obtained. Accumulation and backtracking are performed according to alignment errors. Finally, the time-shift sequence can be obtained to flatten the events.

The prestack surface reflection data can maintain the original waveform, theoretically estimating more accurate Q values. Nevertheless, its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to be lower, and the influence of raypath on Q estimation needs to be considered.

DAS has a wide range of application domains, from geophysics to biology and natural sciences. DAS has gained increasing interest in geophysics during the last decade and the research on it is continuously growing. It has been successfully applied in Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) for both reservoir and CO2 monitoring. Amplitude-Versus-Offset (AVO) analysis on DAS data may also be beneficial to CO 2 monitoring. Another opportunity is the application of FWI on DAS data. Either for FWI or CO2 monitoring with AVO analysis, the precision of DAS data, in terms of both phase and amplitude, should meet a high standard. DAS is actively researched in project-team Makutu Inria and TotalEnergies for the purpose of seismic imaging and CO2 geological storage monitoring. In the ongoing research, we compare three DAS formulae analytically and numerically. On one hand, this comparison is necessary to validate our numerical tools for DAS simulation; on the other hand, a quantitative study on the precision of DAS simulation will help us ensure a good DAS data quality during a FWI workflow.",1482.pdf

Using structural interpretation of seismic reflection profiles, systematic offset measurements, and analysis of isopaches maps, we investigate the structural evolution of these faults and document their episodic re-activations under different stress regimes. The characterization of the age of reactivation, displacement, and fault tendency to propagate into the overlying overburden is crucial for understanding the site's structural characteristics. Additionally, this information is critical in comprehending the geological dynamics of the region.

Our analysis shows normal faulting in the area, with right-lateral strike-slip inferred from the map section. However, we observed a reactivation of normal faults in the north and a ramp-like structure suggesting the Tremiti Fault's significance as a strike-slip zone dividing the North and South Apennines. The reactivation is seen up to the Quaternary, indicating a relatively recent and ongoing geological activity in the region.

This “predictive maintenance” approach, where the subsurface is monitored very frequently, is designed to provide early warnings of potential safety issues or CO2 plume non-conformance in a light and agile operational setup.

The Full Wavefield Migration (FWM) and Joint Migration Inversion (JMI) methods utilize the Full Wavefield Modeling (FWMod) scheme, which incorporates geometric spreading, reflectivity, and transmission effects, as well as multiple scattering. The FWMod process is designed in a modular manner, where wavefield operators describe propagation and reflection/transmission.

However, conventional inversion methods have many challenges to identify ultra-deep fracture-cavity carbonate reservoirs with complicated fault-karst system. In recent years, deep learning technology has been showing a good application prospect in the field of seismic inversion. But the lack of labels of training datasets always imposes limitations heavily on the accuracy and stability of impedance inversion using deep learning. In order to solve these problems, we proposed an adaptive seismic impedance inversion method using a deep 1D convolutional neural network (CNN). The method is based on a semi-supervised learning framework to build a CNN-based inversion model. Training datasets only consist of seismic data and low-frequency impedance data as inputs. Measured impedance is not needed to generate corresponding labels. We defined the inversion objective function including a seismic waveform loss term and a low-frequency constraint loss term. The CNN-based model can adaptively learn the weight factors for the two loss terms during training to improve the performance of the inversion network. The application on synthetic and real seismic data has proved that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of estimated impedance and fracture-cavity carbonate reservoir identification.",1506.pdf
